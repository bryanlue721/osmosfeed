          "description": "Speaking in Hobart Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a financial support package for all those affected by the Devonport jumping castle tragedy.\r\n\r\nYear 6 students Zane Mellor, Peter Dodt, Jye Sheehan, Jalailah Jayne-Maree Jones, all 12-years-old and Addison Stewart, 11, were inside the bouncy house at the time when a large gust of wind threw it 10 metres into the air.\r\n\r\nAt least nine Hillcrest Primary School children were playing inside at the time. Three kids remain in a critical condition in hospital while one is recovering at home.\r\n\r\nThe school was celebrating the end of the year with an event called the \"Big Day In\" where a number of activities were taking place at the school's grounds in Devonport.\r\n\r\n“We are providing $800,000 to support the families and communities affected in counselling support, $250,000 for first responders, $550,000 for the broader community,” Mr Morrison said.\r\n\r\n“This will be paid to Tasmania’s Primary Health Network. It will be provided over an 18-month period, because we know support won’t just be needed in the next few weeks, it will be needed for many, many, many months, to try and begin that process of healing.\r\n\r\n“There’s additional trauma counselling in the $250,000 for those involved, and training for those services in trauma, of informed care and psychological first aid to assist in recovery. The $550,000 includes $200,000 for additional trauma counselling in the community. There’s $200,000 for the local Headspace trauma care and training, and expanded supports for young people.\r\n\r\n“There’s $100,000 to support return-of-school in 2022, including training and counselling for teachers and staff, and $50,000 in community mental health and wellbeing grants to support the community.”",

          "description": "The government seems intent on punishing a public organisation that builds trust between nations\nWhen the UK departed the Erasmus+ scheme at the moment it left the European Union, there were justifiable cries of protest. Losing an exchange programme that enabled young people to enrich their education in Europe was one more needless loss, one more piece of collateral damage self-incurred as a result of the Conservatives’ hard Brexit. But Erasmus+ did not provide good value for money, said the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, and anyway the government would be creating an even better programme, Turing, to create exchanges for young people not just in Europe, but worldwide.\nThe scheme was duly set up by the British Council. But earlier this month the Guardian revealed that Capita will be running the scheme from next year, having undercut the British Council by an unknown sum when the project was put out to tender. So it is that a scheme designed to build relationships between British and overseas students will be run not by the public body in charge of enhancing the UK’s reputation abroad, but by a giant outsourcing firm – one that has turned its hand, not always successfully, to everything from running London’s congestion charge zone to England’s cervical smear programme (the latter was brought back in-house by the NHS in 2019 after serious blunders were made).\n Continue reading...",

I received another on Wednesday, telling me that 50 people had responded to that message, that canvassing was in full swing and that Labour was within a whisker of winning.\nThis sort of wishful – and maybe dishonest – thinking highlights a real problem within Labour, whose leaders and some of whose members are willing to sacrifice the prize of a leftwing majority for I’m not sure what – avoiding a stronger Lib Dem party?

I, however, having sustained a very nasty double break in my ankle, have just been told that the critical surgery necessary to ensure I will be able to walk properly again is delayed because a whole major surgery ward at King’s College hospital has closed due to Covid.\nThe staff are making heroic efforts to get those of us who are on their emergency lists into surgery. To do this they have to make agonising decisions, cancelling elective surgery.

Amy, 10 months old, burbles happily in the background as her mother talks. She is healthy, happy, and oblivious to her status as a world first: one of a handful of babies born from the first sperm bank for HIV-positive donors.\nThe bank, Sperm Positive, launched in New Zealand in 2019, in an effort to reduce the stigma faced by HIV-positive people – and raise awareness that with treatment, the virus was undetectable and untransmissible. It grabbed international headlines when it was launched, but has been more than a publicity gimmick. Two years on, the bank is bearing fruit.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The pandemic eventually caught up with Aotearoa, but 2021 was memorable for gender equality and Māori success stories\nFor eight months of this year, New Zealanders were so rude – or lucky, depending on whether you live inside or outside New Zealand – as to ignore everything that was happening across the world. Delta was washing over Europe in waves, confining much of the continent to their homes and neighbourhoods. Joe Biden was struggling to implement his progressive agenda, crashing against a Republican wall of legislative and judicial obstruction. It was a reminder for Americans and the world that the Trump era wasn’t a brief, violent blip – a temporary interruption to the second American century - but perhaps a permanent feature of their democracy. In Australia, a continent sitting pretty for much of the year, the virus let rip in New South Wales and Victoria, sending Melbourne into one of the world’s longest lockdowns.\nFor New Zealanders, this was a very distant, and “foreign”, problem. In April 50,000 New Zealanders packed out Six60’s gig at Eden Park. That moment, a reminder to the rest of the world that at least one country was living as if Covid never happened, went viral. Tributes were made to the genius of prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, whose tough measures against the virus in March 2020 meant that New Zealanders enjoyed a year more or less like any other. We worked from our offices. We ate out. Our children went to school. We went to birthday parties and funerals and all manner of mass gatherings without the virus threatening to spread at any given moment. We were on top of the world.\n Continue reading...",

I knew what was coming. My wife isn’t someone prone to suggesting we suddenly up sticks and move to Arkansas, or begin new careers in mime artistry. And we’d been talking about names for our imminent first child. Girls’ names had been a particular problem: we’d ended up with a rotating cast of names from Mad Men – Peggys and Bettys and the like – but weren’t fully convinced. I braced myself for a “Gertrude”.\n“What about Romy?” she said. Instantly, I loved it. The name’s roots are basically a Germanic twist on the Latin name Rosemary, but it seems to be more popular in France these days. My wife had been following the rather glam daughter of the editor of French Vogue on Instagram, who called her own daughter Romy. As it turned out, I’d recently done a phone interview with Romy from the xx and was struck by how lovely she’d been to chat to.\nTim Jonze is the associate editor of Guardian Culture\n Continue reading...",

It’s super-adaptable, too\nI’m known as the feeder of my friendship group, so it’s not uncommon for friends to pop round at short notice and just stay for dinner. And what sort of host would I be if I didn’t offer dessert? I love having a few shortcut puddings up my sleeve, and this one is great for the festive season. Using shop-bought puff pastry and a jar of good-quality mincemeat, all you need to do is mix together a frangipane and you’ve got a pretty impressive dessert. It’s super flexible, too, so use whatever you’ve got in: switch the apples for pears, say, add some chopped nuts or mix cocoa powder into the frangipane.\nUK readers: click to buy these ingredients from Ocado\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The Liberal Democrat triumph in this week’s byelection is a damning verdict on Boris Johnson’s leadership\nByelection earthquakes don’t come much bigger than North Shropshire. The result – the former 23,000 Conservative majority overturned into a 6,000-vote win for the new Liberal Democrat MP Helen Morgan – is a bombshell for Boris Johnson, a wake-up call for the Conservative party and a life-enhancing triumph for the Lib Dems. It is also, perhaps, a sign that party politics is emerging from a period largely defined by the Brexit referendum of 2016, with tactical anti-Conservative voting now playing an increasingly important role.\nThursday’s 34% swing to the Lib Dems was spectacular by any yardstick. The Tory share of the vote collapsed by 31 percentage points, almost a modern record. This enabled Ed Davey’s party to come from a distant third place 10% share in 2019 to reach 47%. That surge produced the biggest Conservative to Lib Dem swing since the Christchurch byelection in 1993. Back then, the Lib Dem win was a damning verdict on a Conservative government’s economic competence. The verdict in North Shropshire is no less damning; but this one was focused squarely on the prime minister’s own abject performance and lack of integrity.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "He may be best known for bringing children’s books by Roald Dahl and Michael Rosen to vivid life, but a new documentary reveals the more serious side to illustrator’s career\nQuentin Blake’s ascent to national treasure status has been fuelled by a 70-year career as an illustrator, most prominently of children’s books, and works by one writer in particular. His distinctive and revelatory conjuring of Roald Dahl’s world is one of the glories of late-20th century illustration, but it has sometimes masked other aspects of a remarkable career that’s been about a lot more than just the genius misanthrope of Great Missenden.\nA new BBC documentary, Quentin Blake: The Drawing of My Life, allows for a wider appreciation, opening as it does with the 89-year-old illustrator confronted by 30ft of empty canvas and an invitation to fill it with an artwork that tells the story of his creative life. The broad brush of biography is soon filled in: his 1930s upbringing in suburban Sidcup, south-east London, from where Blake first got his work published in Punch while still at school; his decision to read English at Cambridge rather than going to art school; his 60s career as an in-demand illustrator (his Penguin paperback jackets for the likes of Kingsley Amis’s Lucky Jim have an attractively louche appeal); and as an author himself, most notably A Drink of Water, made with the writer and longtime friend and collaborator, John Yeoman.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "It was the divorce that gripped Britain, involving photographs of the Duchess of Argyll performing oral sex. But, says the writer of the BBC’s new drama, the woman behind the headlines was unfairly vilified\n‘Here’s the thing,” says Sarah Phelps, talking about the Duchess of Argyll. “The first time I heard of her, she was referred to as The Blowjob Duchess.” The screenwriter has made this duchess, Margaret of Argyll, the heroine of A Very British Scandal, a new BBC drama starring Claire Foy and Paul Bettany as the aristos whose divorce transfixed the nation in 1963.\nThanks to a censorious judge, the vile behaviour of the duke, a series of photographs showing the duchess performing fellatio on an unidentified man and her own altruistic, if high-handed, refusal to defend herself, the sexual ins and outs of this separation are a matter of incredibly detailed historical record. “It was,” says Phelps,” all about, ‘Who’s the man?’, ‘Who’s the headless man in the photos?’, ‘How many men did she fuck?’, ‘Who was she blowing?’ And I almost thought, ‘I actually don’t give a shit. I want to know about her. I want to know who she was.’ So the blowjob matters to me in one way. But it matters less in the prurient sense of needing to know who was on the other end of that erection.”\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "In the BBC TV series, treasured objects are restored to their former glory. It’s a vision of how life ought to be\nNothing but good happens in The Repair Shop, a thoroughly commendable television show in which pleasant men and women bring beloved but damaged objects to a team of equally pleasant craftspeople who will repair them and make them like new. At the start of every show we see an ancient thatched barn as Bill Paterson’s reassuring voice sets the scene. This is a place where “precious and faded treasures are restored to their former glory”; where “heritage craft skills passed down the generations” are exercised; a place where, not least, the conversation between owners and restorers “unlocks the story” inside every object.\nInside the barn, the craftspeople are already at work: sandpapering, sawing, sewing, stuffing, burnishing, painting, soldering, hammering, chiselling. The barn is real enough. It was built in around 1700 for a farm in Hampshire and relocated 40 years ago to the Weald and Downland Living Museum in West Sussex, where the series is filmed. But as real barns go, the Repair Shop is unusually smart, its wooden frame robust, its reed-thatch immaculate, and its interior beautifully lit.\nIan Jack is a Guardian columnist\n\n Continue reading...",

Spider-Man is the lonely, sensitive, adolescent underdog whose high-school miseries and humiliations, combined with his secret superheroic triumphs, have been comic-book crack for generations of fascinated fans and a gateway drug to the Marvel world itself.\nHe first appeared in Marvel Comics almost 60 years ago: the orphaned young science prodigy, Peter Parker, bitten by a radioactive spider at an educational exhibit. (Like Godzilla, Spider-Man is a product of the nuclear age.) He acquires the proportionate strength of a spider, a tingly “spider sense” for danger, and the ability to climb up walls. He designs his own body-hugging web-motif costume and web-shooting wrist modules and becomes a superhero, battling people such as the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. But he is somehow unable to reveal his secret to his high-school crush Mary Jane Watson and, as humble Parker, gets bullied by the high-school jock Flash Thompson who – ironically – fan-worships Spider-Man. So Spider-Man’s victories coexist with despair and depression: he fails to save his Uncle Ben, killed by a street criminal, and his entire superhero career is driven by that primal scene of failure and guilt – a Rosebud of wretchedness.\n Continue reading...",

And greater levels of immunity mean a lower ratio of hospitalisations to cases – something we have seen before in the UK, where about 22% of cases in those aged 65 and older ended up in hospital in early 2021, when Alpha was dominant but few had received a vaccine, compared with about 6% after the vaccine rollout was well under way.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "After you’ve written your memoir, publishers these days want anyone famous to write crime novels. We put 10 of the most well-known in the dock\nThe view that everyone has one book in them is disproved by celebrities, who now tend to produce at least two – a memoir and then, courting publishing’s most lucrative market, a crime or thriller novel. The autumn lists include suspense stories from both a former president and a secretary of state of the US, a former UK home secretary, three well-known British TV journalists and a leading quizshow host.\nIn Britain, the celebrity mystery genre began with Dick Francis’s Dead Cert (1962), and continued with Jeffrey Archer’s Not A Penny More, Not A Penny Less (1976). But though known at the time of their debuts for other things – respectively as a jockey and a Conservative MP – Francis and Archer became primarily famous as writers, and so moved beyond the category they established. Also in a different category are Tony Parsons and Lynne Truss, whose recent series of crime novels - latest instalments Your Neighbour’s Wife and Murder By Milk Bottle – followed many novels in other genres. And, while the current culture secretary Nadine Dorries has published much fiction, she has not yet turned to crime.\n Continue reading...",

So it is with a pleasurable shiver of surprise that every time I have opened my fridge over the past week, a bottle of blush-pink Provençal rosé has been casting a rosy glow over my parmesan rinds and Tupperware. Because this is not just any wine; this is Whispering Angel, Adele’s favourite, and the most talked-about tipple of the year.\nIf a song called I Drink Wine didn’t make her #relatable enough, the singer, who is said to be worth £140m, recently revealed her chosen tipple to be this upmarket (£18.99) supermarket wine.

This was unusual – he was usually awake at that hour, worrying about money. My sister, Felicia, said he wasn’t well. He had caught pneumonia. Later, I heard him coughing, so I went to him. He was coughing up blood. I called an ambulance, which took him to hospital at 4am on Christmas Day.\nFelicia, Mum and I thought, OK, Dad’s in hospital with pneumonia, but let’s have Christmas, he’ll be fine. Mum started peeling potatoes and putting the turkey in the oven. Then we heard that, because of an intensive-care bed shortage, Dad had been moved from Darlington – where we lived – to Bishop Auckland hospital 10 miles away. The oven was turned off. Our neighbour took us to the hospital. We stayed there all day, sitting in the waiting room and by his bedside. \n Continue reading...",

West End shows are postponing and even cancelling their Christmas shows as cast members and theatre staff fall ill.\nNosheen Iqbal visits the cast of Sleeping Beauty at the Cube theatre in Corby, Northamptonshire, during their rehearsals for a show still hoping to welcome a full audience for its opening night tonight. But growing concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant and advice from government scientists to limit social interactions have cast doubt on the chances of completing a full run of performances.\n Continue reading...",

                    <span>Finance Minister Simon Birmingham has rejected suggestions Gladys Berejiklian declined to run for the federal seat of Warringah because she thought the government would lose the next election.

It comes after the former NSW premier announced on Friday she is retiring from politics.

Ms Berejiklian spoke to the Prime Minister yesterday, declining his offer for a federal tilt after weeks of intense lobbying for her to make the switch.

Mr Birmingham rejected the suggestion her decision was made with respect to the federal government&#x27;s election chances.

&quot;No, I think it&#x27;s because she wants to do something else with her life,&quot; Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia.</span>

                    <span>Health Minister Greg Hunt says vaccinations for five to 11-year-olds will protect children, their families and schools. 

“We&#x27;re one of the first countries, as the Prime Minister has said, after the US and Canada, to begin a full, national 5- to 11-year-old rollout – as we have been with boosters – and so this is the next step in protecting Australians,&quot; Mr Hunt said during a media conference on Friday. 

&quot;It will give parents confidence, it will give parents choice, it will give children protection.

&quot;It will give their families protection and it will give schools protection, so I think from January the 10th, we hope as many Australian 5- to 11-year-olds as possible will come forward.&quot;</span>

Mr Smollett has been charged with six felony counts of disorderly conduct after Chicago police allege the actor staged a racist and homophobic attack in January, 2019.

Prosecutors claim the 39-year-old actor planned the hoax to get attention and boost his claims for a more lucrative contract.

The actor was later found guilty on five of the six felony charges.</span>

                    <span>New South Wales health officials have announced a second Byron Bay venue of concern after a positive COVID case visited a popular nightclub last week.

Thousands of Schoolies have arrived for a second week of festivities, prompting the urgent warning.

Byron Bay Mayor Michael Lyon says the COVID case is &quot;obviously concerning&quot;.

&quot;We just have to keep following the health orders and be vigilant, and hope this one passes as well,&quot; he told Sky News Australia. 

Mr Lyon said residents across New South Wales should &quot;redouble&quot; their efforts to follow health advice after the state has seen a rise in cases, recording 516 new cases on Friday. 

&quot;We&#x27;re in that new phase so seeing a rise in infections is what we&#x27;re expecting, I guess it&#x27;s just about managing that,&quot; he said.</span>

                    <span>Finance Minister Simon Birmingham says there is optimism skilled migrants and international students will soon be able to return to Australia. 

This comes as Australia&#x27;s international border reopening will be discussed on Friday with the two-week travel ban to end on December 15. 

“I think we should be very optimistic that we will see this sort of opening happen relatively soon,&quot; Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia. 

“Our final decisions and announcement will be made of course by the Prime Minister in due course.&quot;

He said the government has continued to gather as much information as possible about the Omicron variant to ensure a safe reopening. 

“We&#x27;ve been making sure that we get the best possible analysis and evidence and then from there, I think we can confidence that certainly, international students who are looking to start next year should expect to be back in Australia, and that we’re well placed with our very, very, high vaccination rate,&quot; he said.</span>

                    <span>Disgraced actor Jussie Smollett has been found guilty of staging a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago in January 2019.

The 39-year-old was charged with six felony counts of disorderly conduct by Chicago police.

He was found guilty of five of the six charges.

The jury deliberated for roughly nine hours before reaching a unanimous verdict.

Mr Smollett claimed he was walking home when masked men approached him, made racist and homophobic remarks, beat him and looped a noose around his neck before fleeing in the early hours of January 29th.

The story turned out to be a lie.

The actor now faces up to three years in prison.</span>

During the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell in New York the prosecution introduced photographs never before seen publicly, showing the British socialite with Jeffrey Epstein. The images show the close relationship between Maxwell and Epstein, the late, disgraced sex offender who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial, also in New York. Maxwell is charged in relation to procuring underage teen girls between 1994 and 2004 for Epstein, who sexually abused them.

                    <span>Democracy faces &quot;sustained and alarming challenges&quot; worldwide, US President Joe Biden said Thursday at a virtual summit on democracy where he sparked controversy by pointedly not inviting China and Russia.
Biden, who took office in January amid the biggest US political crisis in decades, said trends are &quot;largely pointing in the wrong direction&quot; and that &quot;more than ever, democracy needs champions.&quot;
&quot;We stand at an inflection point,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Will we allow the backward slide of rights and democracy to continue unchecked?&quot;</span>

Cases of the Omicron variant could be spreading even faster in England than in South Africa, according to a senior scientific adviser, who warned that the variant was a “very severe setback” to hopes of bringing the pandemic under control.
Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said that plan B measures announced by the prime minister were “absolutely not an overreaction” even if Omicron turned out to be milder than the current dominant variant.

Downing Street is facing a damaging revolt over planned Covid restrictions after dozens of Tory backbenchers threatened to rebel or abstain in fury over the proposed new rules and Boris Johnson’s handling of the Christmas party scandal.
With at least 30 Conservative MPs already expected to vote against regulations on masks, home working and vaccine passports, and many more now vowing to stay away from Tuesday’s vote, the prime minister could be left relying on Labour support to win.

The 2021 iteration was forced online as a result of Covid-19 and while next year’s will still have a virtual component, the Utah-based festival will bring back limited in-person screenings, events and parties. The lineup includes 82 films, which is up from last year’s total of 72 but still down from the previous year’s 118.

Taliban militants in Pakistan have declared an end to a month-long ceasefire arranged with the aid of the Afghan Taliban, accusing the government of breaching terms including a prisoner release agreement and the formation of negotiating committees.
The Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), are a separate movement from the Afghan Taliban and have fought for years to overthrow the government in Islamabad and rule with their own brand of Islamic sharia law.

                    <span>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday expanded authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid booster to include 16- and 17-year-olds, amid growing concern over the Omicron variant&#x27;s ability to overcome immunity conferred by two shots.
The FDA&#x27;s decision comes a day after the companies released the results of lab tests that showed three doses appeared effective against Omicron, while two doses were probably not enough to stop infection -- though they may still prevent severe disease.</span>

                    <span>Leicester’s European campaign will go on but not in the way they wanted and, perhaps more distressingly, there is no end in sight to their defensive problems. Brendan Rodgers’ team contributed embarrassingly to their own defeat to an under-strength Napoli side and, as a result, dropped out of the Europa League and into the less-vaunted Europa Conference League.
“With all due respect to the competition, I’m not sure what it is,” said Rodgers, who was equally frank about his team’s shortcomings after another vexing defeat. “We were good offensively but nowhere near good enough defensively,” he said “We’ve played a number of systems and shapes [this season], individually it comes down to being able to have that mentality to track a runner or stop a cross. These are basics of the game that we’re not doing well.”

Meanwhile, new applications for unemployment benefits last week fell to just 184,000, the lowest level since September 1969, the Labor Department said Thursday.</span>

Loujain al-Hathloul, the prominent Saudi women’s rights activist, has filed a lawsuit against three former US intelligence and military officers who have admitted in a US court to helping carry out hacking operations on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.
In her lawsuit, which was filed in a US district court in Oregon in conjunction with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Hathloul alleged that the actions of three men – Marc Baier, Ryan Adams, and Daniel Gericke – led to her iPhone being hacked and communication being exfiltrated by UAE security officials.

                    <span>The street in front of the embassy of Saudi Arabia will be called &quot;Jamal Khashoggi Way,&quot; after the Washington city council voted to honor the Saudi journalist murdered by government agents.
The council voted unanimously on Tuesday to symbolically name the 700-foot (213-meter) stretch of New Hampshire Avenue that runs between the embassy and the Watergate complex for Khashoggi, a dissident journalist working for The Washington Post at the time of his murder in Turkey.</span>

Efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal have been hauled back from the brink of collapse as Tehran revised its stance after pressure from Russia and China and clear warnings that the EU and the US were preparing to walk away.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Scotland’s national public health body is “strongly urging” people to cancel Christmas parties after a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to festive get-togethers.
Dr Nick Phin, the director of public health science and medical director at Public Health Scotland (PHS), said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new Covid variant is much more transmissible. The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties.

Dr Martens will raise the price of its famous footwear by £10 a pair next summer, after the shoemaker said increases in the price of raw materials and transport had added to its costs.
The British brand said prices would rise in both Europe and the US as the cost of almost every aspect of its footwear had gone up – including the leather, metal eyelets, soles and shipping costs – because of demand for commodities and wage inflation.

                    <span>The cabinet secretary must be kept under pressure to protect the public interest and the rule of law not the prime minister
It is extremely tempting to dismiss the inquiry into last year’s Downing Street Christmas parties as a phoney exercise that will produce a bucket of Whitehall whitewash. After all, the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, who is conducting the inquiry, was handpicked by Boris Johnson to be his principal civil servant only last year. And few prime ministers, least of all one as slippery as Mr Johnson, are in the habit of assigning such inquiries to people who could make life difficult for them.
Mr Case may also have played a role in the events he is investigating. Although the Cabinet Office says Mr Case did not attend any of the Christmas “gatherings”, it is not clear whether he was the source of the “repeated assurances” on which Mr Johnson relies to claim that there was no Christmas party in No 10 in 2020. Common sense suggests he may have been, and the paymaster general, Michael Ellis, twice failed to answer the question on Thursday. If he was indeed that source, and the inquiry concludes that there was no party, it will be a tainted finding. If he concludes that there was one, Mr Case’s own head may be on the block. For these reasons, it would have been better to give the job to someone more clearly independent.

                    <span>Ministers have announced a plan B. Now they must ensure it can be implemented
Work from home if you can; wear face masks when in public indoor spaces (except when eating, drinking or exercising); use the NHS app to prove you are vaccinated, or have recently tested negative, when entering venues with large crowds. New rules for England announced on Wednesday, and known as plan B, are intended to slow the spread of the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, with UK cases said to be doubling every three days or faster. They follow strong advice to get a booster, with the programme extended to everyone over 40 who had their previous dose more than three months ago, and a plan to recruit 10,000 more vaccinators.
Concerns are high around levels of public compliance, with fears that the political row surrounding reports of parties in Westminster last winter, as well as more general fatigue concerning restrictions, could undermine people’s willingness to adjust their behaviour. The decision not to vaccinate children under 12 is also under attack, given that Covid case rates are highest in this age group and also among adults aged 35-49 – a cohort that includes many of these children’s parents. In the US and elsewhere, younger children are being vaccinated.

Scottish ministers have promised record spending on cutting climate emissions and on housing improvements, in a budget that also put heavy emphasis on tackling poverty and low pay.
Kate Forbes, the finance secretary, said the Scottish government would invest £2bn in low-carbon spending and record sums in childhood poverty measures, adult disability, free school meals, and free bus travel for all young people. There was also a record £18bn for the health service and social care.

                    <span>The hubbub of an Indonesian reef should comes as no surprise: the world below is alive with sound
A coral reef in Indonesia thought to be dead has been discovered to be erupting with glorious uproar – the sound of fishes whooping and grunting as they communicate and search for food. It’s like Finding Nemo come to life. We shouldn’t be surprised. The ocean, like Prospero’s island in The Tempest, is full of strange noises. It crackles and it roars. Jacques Cousteau may have been a great ocean explorer, but when he made his film The Silent World in 1956, I wonder whether he was actually listening down there, through the bubbles of his aqualung.
Sound travels five times faster in the water. The ocean is a giant conductor of sound, an aquatic internet for every organism in it. They feel it in their bodies, and as they create sound, they are physically reaching out: from pistol shrimps that snap their claws so loudly that the sound makes them seem a hundred times bigger, to the great whales who, as Roger Payne, the first person to record and release whale song, has observed, make a sound as big as the ocean itself, and which can be heard for thousands of miles. A humpback in the Caribbean can be heard by a fellow whale off the coast of Europe. At 230 decibels (an aeroplane 100 feet away reaches 140dB), sperm whales are the loudest animals on Earth. Diving with these cetaceans in three-mile-deep waters off the Azores, I had to sign a consent form from the islands’ government, waiving liability should my hearing be damaged. Indeed, when I was first echo-located by a large female sperm whale, I felt her sonar clicks judder through my body like an MRI scanner.

After a 20-year hiatus, Sex and the City will return on 9 December with the sequel And Just Like That. Most of the main cast will return for the reboot, with the exception of Kim Cattrall as Samantha. 
There will also be new additions, including Sara Ramirez, who will play the host of a podcast to which Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is now a contributor – perhaps a natural progression from her job in SATC as a weekly columnist.

On Wednesday the Today show in the US released a video of Hillary Clinton reading the speech she would have given if she had beaten Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

She said reading it entailed “facing one of my most public defeats head-on”.

The charity regulator should stay as far as possible out of debates about “wokeness”, the government’s preferred candidate to head the watchdog has told MPs, saying he does not believe charities are too political.
Martin Thomas told MPs on the Commons culture select committee that the Charity Commission should be firmly independent of government, and he saw no need to change the rules around political campaigning by charities.

                    <span>The singer says noise and pyrotechnics made it impossible to see the crush developing in the crowd
Travis Scott has said he didn’t notice concertgoers pleading for help, during his first interview since the devastating crowd crush at Astroworld that left 10 fans dead and hundreds injured. “It’s just been a lot of thoughts, a lot of feelings, a lot of grieving,” he said, “just trying to wrap my head around it.”
Over the course of an hour-long interview with Charlamagne tha God, the host of the Breakfast Club radio show, Scott was serious and downcast. He said he wasn’t aware of anything amiss until a news conference was called after his set. “People pass out, things happen at concerts – but something like that?” he said, his voice trailing.

My initial reaction to hearing of the Christmas party and the fake news briefing was feeling as if I had been kicked in the stomach (PM accused of lying after No 10 officials caught joking about Christmas party, 7 December). Then I cried.
Like the majority of people in this country, I’ve followed the rules from the start. In my 60-odd years on the planet, I’ve paid my dues, I’ve voted in every election since turning 18 and I’ve tried to be decent and honest.

The mindset and language of Tory politicians discussing broadcasting and the arts is disturbing. Charlotte Higgins highlights the letter which the former culture secretary Oliver Dowden wrote to Arts Council England and other bodies about their approach to issues of contested heritage being “consistent with the government’s position” (An atmosphere of threat lingers over the arts – and it’s created by the government, 6 December).
Robert Jenrick, then communities secretary, said in January: “We won’t allow people to censor our past.” A month later Dowden said: “Purging uncomfortable elements of our past does nothing but damage our understanding of it.”

                    <span>Analysis: scientists say home working makes sense but voice fears over advice to go ahead with parties amid steep trajectory in cases

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Work from home, but keep going to Christmas parties: Boris Johnson’s advice has prompted questions about the logic behind plan B and left a lingering sense of confusion about the scale of the threat posed by the Omicron variant. So does the plan stand up to scrutiny?
Scientists say that making working from home a first line of defence, ahead of social gatherings, is not necessarily a frivolous choice. In the hierarchy of measures that can be deployed, working from home is an effective way to bring down people’s daily contacts and is relatively painless economically.

                    <span>Relationship changed ‘not in a positive way’, says Verstappen
Race director warns that rule-breaking could see points docked

Tensions between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen ratcheted up again on Thursday before the Formula One season decider at this weekend’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The pair go into the season finale tied on points with their increasingly fractious relationship exacerbated by repeated incidents on track. With the possibility of the title being decided by a crash, Verstappen was unequivocal that his feelings toward the world champion had fundamentally deteriorated.
Incidents between the pair and their Mercedes and Red Bull teams – including two major crashes at Silverstone and Monza and most recently further untoward duelling at the last round in Saudi Arabia – have punctuated the season. Last weekend Verstappen was given two time penalties for driving infringements, including having been adjudged to have braked erratically in front of Hamilton causing him to hit the back of the Dutch driver’s Red Bull car.

Lina Wertmüller dies aged 93

I last saw Lina Wertmüller on the stage of the Buñuel auditorium at the Cannes film festival in 2019, surrounded by cheering fans: a tiny, fiercely alert and beaming figure in her early 90s. She was there because Pasqualino Settebellezze, or Seven Beauties (1975), her strange, serio-comic masterpiece was being shown; this famously made her the first woman to be nominated for an Academy Award as best director.
Seven Beauties is an absurdist anti-war satire, starring her favourite leading man Giancarlo Giannini – a roguishly handsome but unsettling presence who was to her movies, perhaps, what Marcello Mastroianni was to Federico Fellini, and Wertmüller started out as assistant to Fellini. Fellini was her mentor and friend, and she, in turn, was his lifelong passionate admirer as a creative life force – and yet it was arguably Wertmüller who had more mordant and subversive things to say about the postwar Italian soul.

How about the rest of us? How would we cope with the prospect of impending apocalypse? By facing the end of the world with sobriety and compassion? Or drowning ourselves in sex, drugs and celebrity gossip? Might some of us even enjoy the drama?

                    <span>Thomas Schreiber, 35, says he did not want to kill landowner or his mother but ‘demonic’ thoughts took hold
An aspiring artist who killed one of Britain’s wealthiest landowners and repeatedly stabbed his own mother has told a jury he went “completely crazy” after a voice in his head shouted: “Attack, attack, attack,” following months of rising family tensions exacerbated by being “trapped” in Covid lockdowns.
Thomas Schreiber, 35, insisted he had not wanted to kill the hotelier and landowner Sir Richard Sutton or his mother, Anne Schreiber, but “demonic” thoughts took hold and he could not stop stabbing them both.

With one week to go before voters head to the polls in the North Shropshire byelection, the Downing Street Christmas party scandal has prompted some last-minute doubts.
“Boris has let us down, hasn’t he,” said Wendy Young, 72, who along with her husband has long voted Conservative in general elections. “I’m not sure who I’ll vote for now, but I am considering switching.”

                    <span>Boris Johnson may yet survive, but each self-inflicted disaster leaves Starmer in a stronger position
“Beginning of the end for Boris?” The strapline across the front of his own Daily Telegraph answers its own question. His end was always contained in his beginning: his fatal flaws were always destined to destroy him. The questions are when, and how? Can he prolong the inevitable and defy gravity yet again?
He was not elected for his gravity. Quite the opposite, pollsters say: he was elected as the party man to lift the country’s spirits, so it is little surprise that he and his wife run a party house with showstopping £850-a-roll gold wallpaper. New babies are part of the fun: how many – seven or eight, who cares? There is a lobe in voters’ brains that likes to vote for fun: whose gang would you choose, whose party would you go to, who would you drink with in the pub? David Cameron and his gang had it: those pictures with Samantha on holiday in Cornwall, their glamorous aristocratic circle, chillaxing with video games and country suppers – and yes, let’s face it, the sheen of Eton. Why else would we elect 20 Old Etonian prime ministers? Miserable Theresa May had not a drop of fun, and plummeted. Boris Johnson has it in spades, but how much is too much?

A few years ago, a popular pub quiz question involved naming 10 famous Belgians. The answers often revealed more about British cultural ignorance than Belgium’s ability to produce international celebrities, given that the fictional Tintin and Hercule Poirot were the best many could come up with.
The game has got easier since the rise of Angèle, a stridently feminist Belgian pop singer-songwriter who shot to fame in 2016 after posting short clips singing covers and playing the piano on Instagram. She was young, talented and not afraid to make fun of herself, pulling faces and sticking pencils up her nose. Her 2018 debut album, Brol, sold a million copies; by 2019, she was a face of Chanel. “I’d always wanted a career in music, but I was thinking more of working as a piano accompanist,” she says, folding into an armchair at a five-star boutique hotel near the Paris Opéra. “I really didn’t expect it to happen like that.”

At the time she was selling about 80% of the fruit she grew but last year’s wildfire caused smoke taint – where grapes absorb smoke, affecting the quality of wine they produce.

Almost two-thirds of the hundreds of mollusc species that live in the deep sea are at risk of extinction, according to a new study that rings another alarm bell over the impact on biodiversity of mining the seabed.

I recently heard the story of a servicewoman in the armed forces who a few years ago was subject to an act of alleged assault by a colleague. The incident was reported to the military authorities and a wealth of evidence was provided, including pictures of bruising, eyewitness accounts and a detailed video statement.
Justice has still not been served.

                    <span>The Random Restaurant Twitter feed shows that mini chip fryer baskets and terrible food photos are a planet-wide phenomenon
It’s a familiar image. There’s a well-stacked burger: domed bun, a couple of patties, the crimson flash of fresh tomato. It’s not unappetising. Next to it, however, is an emblem for all that is naff, irritating and deathly in the restaurant world: a mini chip fryer basket full of chips. Because what could be more fun than a miniaturised version of a piece of kitchen equipment? It’s exactly the kind of thing you’d expect to find in a dreary low-rent British gastropub; one that has decided crass serving items are a substitute for a commitment to good food.
Except this image is not from a clumsy gastro pub. It’s certainly not from Britain. It’s from Fast Food Le Jasmin, a restaurant in Guelma, in north-eastern Algeria. I can show you other examples from Costa Rica and French Polynesia. For the joyous revelation that restaurant stupidity is not restricted to the UK, we must thank a Twitter account called Random Restaurant or @_restaurant_bot, created by one Joe Schoech. As its name suggests, it uses a bot to search Google randomly for information on restaurants all over the world. Around 20 times a day it posts a map link, plus the first four photographs it finds. Certain countries, including China, are excluded because Google isn’t available there. Otherwise, it provides an extraordinary window on how we eat out globally.

                    <span>He is terrified of being without me and has panic attacks at the idea of not being able to join me on work trips. I find it a turn-off and it is sucking the joy out of my job


My husband and I have been together for four years, although we married recently. We love each other very much and have regular, enjoyable sex.
The issue is that since lockdown my husband is terrified of being without me. I have to travel for work, and he is having panic attacks at the concept of not being able to come with me. (He often can, as he is able to work remotely, but it’s not always practical.) He counts down the days from when we last had sex, especially if I’m in a busy period at work or will have to travel soon. I find that quite stressful and a turn-off. If we can’t be together working from home, he wants to spend all our evenings together, and gets upset if I read an article on my phone, even if I’m cuddling him as I do it. If friends or family are coming to visit, he is stressed for at least a week beforehand about getting to spend enough time with me before they arrive. I’m nervous about mentioning work commitments that take me away from home overnight.

Where would we be without the Thursday quiz? On one of the other days of the week I guess. All your favourites are here as you face 15 topical or general knowledge questions. Can you spot the hidden Doctor Who reference? Can you avoid the lure of answering Kate Bush to the music question? And will Ron from Sparks end up disappointed with you – yet again? It is not entirely serious, but let us know how you got on in the comments.
The Thursday quiz, No 33

                    <span>Student debt in America has become a crisis for millions of citizens that often feels like it will last for people’s whole lives
Jennifer Rae Wilson, a social worker and single mother of three children in Richland, Washington, has struggled with student loan debt since she went back to school and graduated in 2000 – more than two decades ago.
Struggling to raise three boys with very little child support, Wilson decided to attend college 10 years after graduating high school to improve her career prospects. She was eventually able to move out of low-income assistance housing and off government assistance programs.

                    <span>A grocery revolution is underway, with individual items available at your door in next to no time. What does it mean for supermarkets, our wallets, working conditions and the planet?
In a warehouse by Farringdon station, in central London, I am watching people burn through millions of pounds of investment in real time.

                    <span>In the face of the impending climate catastrophe, there has been a growing clamour to repopulate the trillions of trees our planet has lost over the centuries. But large-scale tree planting is not helping, and in some cases it&#x27;s creating more problems for the environment. Josh Toussaint-Strauss discusses how we&#x27;ve been getting tree planting wrong, and what we should be doing instead to safeguard precious ecosystems and reduce greenhouse gases

                    <span>People of color and low-income residents are disproportionately affected by Amazon’s warehouses, a Consumer Reports investigation found
Last year, with little warning, a new Amazon delivery station brought the rumble of semi-trailer trucks and delivery vans to Chicago’s Gage Park neighborhood.
The warehouse, located within 1,500 feet of five schools, is in a residential area where more than half the people within a mile have low incomes and nearly 90% are Hispanic.
Amazon opens most of its warehouses in neighborhoods with a comparatively high number of people of color. Nationally, 69% of Amazon warehouses have more people of color living within a one mile radius than the median neighborhood in their metro areas. Some of these are communities where other industrial facilities already cause residents worry about poor air quality, excessive noise and traffic.
The neighborhoods are poorer, too – 57% of Amazon warehouses are in communities with more low-income residents than typical for the metro area they’re in.
It’s just the opposite for Whole Foods and other Amazon retail stores. These tend to be located in a city’s wealthier, whiter neighborhoods, away from the communities where Amazon runs its warehouses.
Warehouse operators are not generally accountable for air pollution from the accompanying trucks and vans. Existing air quality monitoring networks are too spread out to pick up local emissions.
Community activists are asking local, state and federal officials to step in and regulate pollution from warehouse-related traffic and to consider an area’s existing environmental hazards before allowing new warehouses to open there.

                    <span>They make brilliant companions, but do dogs really feel empathy for humans - and what is going through their minds when they play, panic or attack?
Read more: the inner lives of cats: what our feline friends really think 
It is humanity’s great frustration, to gaze into the eyes of a dog, feel so very close to the creature, and yet have no clue what it’s thinking. It’s like the first question you ask of a recently born baby, with all that aching, loving urgency: is that a first smile? Or yet more wind? Except that it’s like that for ever.
I can never know what my staffie is thinking. Does Romeo realise that what he just did was funny, and did he do it on purpose? Is he laughing on the inside? Can he smile? Can he feel anxious about the future? Can he remember life as a puppy? Does he still get the horn, even though I had his knackers off some years ago? And, greater than all these things: does he love me? I mean, really love me, the way I love him?

                    <span>Nina Gladitz dedicated her life to proving the Triumph of the Will director’s complicity with the horrors of Nazism. In the end, she succeeded – but at a cost
On 20 November 1984, in the southern German city of Freiburg, two film-makers faced each other in court for the first day of a trial that was to last nearly two and a half years. The plaintiff, Leni Riefenstahl, had been Hitler’s favourite film-maker. Now 82, she showed up to court in a sheepskin coat over a beige suit, her blond hair set in a large neat perm framing a tanned face. The defendant was a striking, dark-haired 32-year-old documentary maker. Her name was Nina Gladitz, and the outcome of the trial would shape the rest of her life.
During the Nazi era, Riefenstahl had been the regime’s most skilled propagandist, directing films that continue to be both reviled for their glorification of the Third Reich and considered landmarks of early cinema for their innovations and technical mastery. Once the second world war was over, Riefenstahl sought to distance herself from the regime she had served, portraying herself as an apolitical naif whose only motivation was making the most beautiful art possible. “I don’t know what I should apologise for,” she once said. “All my films won the top prize.”

Through the rains and steamy heat of November, day and night, Anupama S Chandran sat by the gates of the Kerala state secretariat. She refused to eat, drink or be moved. Her single demand was written on a placard: “Give me my baby.”
The story of Chandran’s fight to get back her child, who was snatched from her by her own family days after he was born and put up for adoption without her knowledge, is one that has been greeted with both horror and a sad familiarity in India.

When the Taliban entered Kabul in August and completed their takeover of Afghanistan, thousands of people scrambled for the last remaining flights out of the city’s airport. It was chaos that turned deadly: a bomb attack on the airport’s perimeter killed more than 70 people as they crowded the fences, desperate for a way out. Now testimony from a whistleblower who was working on the UK government’s response to the crisis paints a picture of a callous, complacent and incompetent Foreign Office.
It’s a picture that rings true for the Guardian’s senior foreign reporter Emma Graham-Harrison, who tells Michael Safi that while some of the staff in the Foreign Office acted heroically, the system as a whole had huge failings. The government has rejected the account of the whistleblower. A spokesperson said: “Regrettably we were not able to evacuate all those we wanted to, but … since the end of the operation we have helped more than 3,000 individuals leave Afghanistan.”

                    <span>‘He had been used for logging on the Andaman Islands. When I found him, he was 60, living in retirement – and loving his swims’
I lived at sea for 10 years. I co-owned and ran a global kiteboarding expedition business. We’d sail around the world on a 60-foot catamaran, following the trade winds, kiteboarding, surfing and paragliding in remote locations. One night, I watched a Hollywood movie called The Fall, which had a section where an elephant was swimming in tropical blue water. I didn’t know if it was real or a fake Hollywood thing. But I thought: “Man, if that does exist, I’d love to photograph it.”
I searched the internet and found the elephant from the film was living in the Andaman Islands, an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal. When we sailed into the capital, Port Blair, a few months later in 2010, I decided to hop off and try to find this elephant.

China had its sputnik moment in March 2016. That month an artificial intelligence programme, AlphaGo, beat a South Korean grandmaster at Go, an extremely complex and demanding Chinese board game. The five game series was watched by an audience of more than 280 million viewers across China. In May 2017 AlphaGo defeated China’s 19-year-old prodigy Ke Jie; two months later the Chinese government issued an AI strategy which projected that the country would become the global centre of AI innovation by 2030. By year’s end, China accounted for nearly half of all AI venture funding globally.
That is the story of how China became an AI powerhouse, as told by Kai-Fu Lee, a renowned expert in the field, in his book AI Superpowers. Lee, a 60-year-old former president of Google China who has witnessed the country’s tech revolution first-hand, is now chairman and chief executive of Beijing-based tech investment firm Sinovation Ventures. The book was published three years ago and it predicted that China would win the AI contest with the United States – the other great power in AI.

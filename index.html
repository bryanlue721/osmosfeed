                    <span>Australian families are expected to enjoy lobsters at low prices again this Christmas. 

China’s export ban means lobsters could cost just $20 but could reach as much as $150 for two kilograms. 

Western Australian fishers have been allowed to sell up to 400 off the back of their boats this month, in a program which has sold more than 90,000 lobsters since September 2020.</span>

                    <span>Speaking in Hobart Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a financial support package for all those affected by the Devonport jumping castle tragedy.

Year 6 students Zane Mellor, Peter Dodt, Jye Sheehan, Jalailah Jayne-Maree Jones, all 12-years-old and Addison Stewart, 11, were inside the bouncy house at the time when a large gust of wind threw it 10 metres into the air.

At least nine Hillcrest Primary School children were playing inside at the time. Three kids remain in a critical condition in hospital while one is recovering at home.

The school was celebrating the end of the year with an event called the &quot;Big Day In&quot; where a number of activities were taking place at the school&#x27;s grounds in Devonport.

“We are providing $800,000 to support the families and communities affected in counselling support, $250,000 for first responders, $550,000 for the broader community,” Mr Morrison said.

“This will be paid to Tasmania’s Primary Health Network. It will be provided over an 18-month period, because we know support won’t just be needed in the next few weeks, it will be needed for many, many, many months, to try and begin that process of healing.

“There’s additional trauma counselling in the $250,000 for those involved, and training for those services in trauma, of informed care and psychological first aid to assist in recovery. The $550,000 includes $200,000 for additional trauma counselling in the community. There’s $200,000 for the local Headspace trauma care and training, and expanded supports for young people.

“There’s $100,000 to support return-of-school in 2022, including training and counselling for teachers and staff, and $50,000 in community mental health and wellbeing grants to support the community.”</span>

                    <span>Squad morale is ‘very down’ before Sunday’s visit of Liverpool
Spurs are reeling from postponements and training disruption

First the good news. Antonio Conte said on Friday lunchtime that of the nine first-team players to have tested positive for Covid over a tumultuous two weeks or so at Tottenham, only two remained in isolation. “Now the situation is good for us … now we are going out of this situation,” the manager said. And yet, as Sunday’s visit of a rampant Liverpool heaves into view, it is plain that things are a long way from being ideal.
The broad outline of the Spurs outbreak, which took hold around the Norwich game on 5 December and was the first of several to derail Premier League clubs this season, is instructive.

                    <span>Two wins from the last five league games have frustrated the manager but he warns results can leave you ‘horribly misled’
Chelsea cannot afford to stumble again when they visit Wolves on Sunday. They are in danger of losing sight of Manchester City and Liverpool after winning three of their past seven league games and it is difficult to agree with Thomas Tuchel’s insistence that there was little wrong with his side’s performance in their sloppy 1-1 draw with Everton on Thursday.
“We have good performances, sometimes very good, but we don’t have the results,” Tuchel says. “This is exactly the place where you don’t want to be. If you have bad performances and don’t have the results you just focus on the performance and you speak it out loud.

In a blow to European mediators, Iran requested a new pause in the talks in Vienna, which aim to bring the United States back into the 2015 agreement and roll back nuclear activities. The Islamic republic stepped up its nuclear projects after the US withdrawal.
The talks had just resumed in late November after a five-month break following the election of a new hardline government in Iran.</span>

The senator has been a key obstructionist in gutting the president’s agenda that was previously $3.5 trillion

On Dec. 15, the child tax credit went out to 181,000 families in his home state of West Virginia, giving an average of $446 to support 305,000 children. Biden expanded the child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 and $3,600 per child under the age of 6.</span>

In 2010, an Indian mining company bought some tenements over a giant and untapped coal basin in the west of Queensland.

                    <span>Wildlife officials and ecologists say urgent and drastic measures are needed to eradicate mice, a threat to island’s endemic species
A plan to eradicate a “plague-level infestation” of invasive mice on California’s Farallon Islands by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters has been approved by state officials.
After hours of impassioned debate, coastal commissioners voted 5-3 in favor of the long-controversial plan put forth by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The approval comes despite the objections of local environmental activists who fear that rodenticide will kill not only the invasive mice, but also gulls and burrowing owls.

                    <span>The government seems intent on punishing a public organisation that builds trust between nations
When the UK departed the Erasmus+ scheme at the moment it left the European Union, there were justifiable cries of protest. Losing an exchange programme that enabled young people to enrich their education in Europe was one more needless loss, one more piece of collateral damage self-incurred as a result of the Conservatives’ hard Brexit. But Erasmus+ did not provide good value for money, said the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, and anyway the government would be creating an even better programme, Turing, to create exchanges for young people not just in Europe, but worldwide.
The scheme was duly set up by the British Council. But earlier this month the Guardian revealed that Capita will be running the scheme from next year, having undercut the British Council by an unknown sum when the project was put out to tender. So it is that a scheme designed to build relationships between British and overseas students will be run not by the public body in charge of enhancing the UK’s reputation abroad, but by a giant outsourcing firm – one that has turned its hand, not always successfully, to everything from running London’s congestion charge zone to England’s cervical smear programme (the latter was brought back in-house by the NHS in 2019 after serious blunders were made).

                    <span>Readers respond to the triumph of the Liberal Democrats in Thursday’s byelection, and the necessity of tactical voting 
As a member of the Labour party for 50 years, a week before Thursday’s North Shropshire byelection, I received an email claiming that Labour was within six percentage points of the Tories and closing, and urging me to join the telephone canvass. I received another on Wednesday, telling me that 50 people had responded to that message, that canvassing was in full swing and that Labour was within a whisker of winning.
This sort of wishful – and maybe dishonest – thinking highlights a real problem within Labour, whose leaders and some of whose members are willing to sacrifice the prize of a leftwing majority for I’m not sure what – avoiding a stronger Lib Dem party? Maximising the Labour vote? Whatever the reason, it is damaging to the country and to the prospect of a Labour government.

I don’t know why people are saying there is a risk that the NHS will buckle; it already has (Hospitals in England draw up plans for significant Covid staff absences, 17 December). This Christmas I hope some children get to enjoy the National Theatre’s Peter Pan, in which I played Wendy, online. I, however, having sustained a very nasty double break in my ankle, have just been told that the critical surgery necessary to ensure I will be able to walk properly again is delayed because a whole major surgery ward at King’s College hospital has closed due to Covid.
The staff are making heroic efforts to get those of us who are on their emergency lists into surgery. To do this they have to make agonising decisions, cancelling elective surgery. If I can’t ever go on the flying wires again on the Olivier stage, or walk properly, it will be a tragedy for me, but nothing compared to the incalculable deaths sustained because there aren’t enough ambulances or ICU beds for people with fatal conditions.

                    <span>Sperm Positive launched in New Zealand in 2019 in an effort to reduce the stigma faced by HIV-positive people 
Olivia and Amy are sitting outside in the shade, trying to escape from New Zealand’s early-summer humidity. Amy, 10 months old, burbles happily in the background as her mother talks. She is healthy, happy, and oblivious to her status as a world first: one of a handful of babies born from the first sperm bank for HIV-positive donors.
The bank, Sperm Positive, launched in New Zealand in 2019, in an effort to reduce the stigma faced by HIV-positive people – and raise awareness that with treatment, the virus was undetectable and untransmissible. It grabbed international headlines when it was launched, but has been more than a publicity gimmick. Two years on, the bank is bearing fruit.

                    <span>The pandemic eventually caught up with Aotearoa, but 2021 was memorable for gender equality and Māori success stories
For eight months of this year, New Zealanders were so rude – or lucky, depending on whether you live inside or outside New Zealand – as to ignore everything that was happening across the world. Delta was washing over Europe in waves, confining much of the continent to their homes and neighbourhoods. Joe Biden was struggling to implement his progressive agenda, crashing against a Republican wall of legislative and judicial obstruction. It was a reminder for Americans and the world that the Trump era wasn’t a brief, violent blip – a temporary interruption to the second American century - but perhaps a permanent feature of their democracy. In Australia, a continent sitting pretty for much of the year, the virus let rip in New South Wales and Victoria, sending Melbourne into one of the world’s longest lockdowns.
For New Zealanders, this was a very distant, and “foreign”, problem. In April 50,000 New Zealanders packed out Six60’s gig at Eden Park. That moment, a reminder to the rest of the world that at least one country was living as if Covid never happened, went viral. Tributes were made to the genius of prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, whose tough measures against the virus in March 2020 meant that New Zealanders enjoyed a year more or less like any other. We worked from our offices. We ate out. Our children went to school. We went to birthday parties and funerals and all manner of mass gatherings without the virus threatening to spread at any given moment. We were on top of the world.

An uneasy Christmas truce has been called over the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, even as the EU said it would not negotiate over a key British demand in the rancorous talks.
Maroš Šefčovič, the EU Brexit commissioner, said there was “momentum” behind discussions after a major British U-turn, but refused to offer quid pro quo concessions.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that his $1.75tn economic and climate legislative package will miss the Christmas deadline for Senate passage and will not pass Congress in the waning weeks of this year.
Negotiations for the president’s Build Back Better bill, for which the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, set a Christmas deadline, have stalled as the centrist Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has withheld his support for the bill in its current form, making him a key vote in the evenly split Senate.

                    <span>Voters in Chile&#x27;s runoff presidential election Sunday can be roughly divided into four camps: pro-change, anti-&quot;communist&quot;, undecided, and apathetic.
Concerns range from rising crime and protecting meager pension savings, to job creation, expanding social welfare, and guarding civil liberties.
With two candidates on opposite sides of the political spectrum, analysts say many voters in a country that tends to balk at radical or sudden change, will vote out of fear of the other, or not at all.</span>

                    <span>A court in Germany ruled in favor of the English blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter Eric Clapton Wednesday after a woman tried to cell her husband&#x27;s CD on eBay for $11.20.

The CD was a recording of a live concert Clapton did in the 1990s. The woman, 55, from the Düsseldorf area, claims that she did not know that attempting to sell the CD would be illegal. Her husband allegedly purchased the CD in 1987 from a department store.</span>

Attempts to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are “rapidly reaching the end of the road”, European negotiators have warned, as talks in Vienna adjourned to allow the Iranian negotiator to return home for consultation – a pause described by the Europeans as disappointing.
“We hope that Iran is in a position to resume the talks quickly, and to engage constructively so that talks can move at a faster pace,” France, Germany and the UK said. “As we have said, there are weeks not months before the deal’s core non-proliferation benefits are lost. We are rapidly reaching the end of the road for this negotiation.

Eric Clapton has won a legal case against a 55-year-old German woman selling a bootleg live CD for €9.95 (£8.45), Deutsche Welle reports.
The woman, known as Gabriele P, claimed she was unaware that she was committing copyright infringement by listing the CD titled Eric Clapton – Live USA, which contains recordings of performances from the 1980s, on eBay. She told the court that the listing was removed after one day.

                    <span>Johnson was a magnet for new voters. But many are appalled by his lies, and traditional Conservatives don’t trust him either
At last. For the first time since he became prime minister, Boris Johnson is paying a direct price for his actions. For two long years, he seemed to defy the laws of political gravity, somehow floating high in the sky when his conduct, whether his lies or his failures, should have seen him crash to the ground.
His mishandling of the first phase of the pandemic was so disastrous, he presided over both the highest death toll in Europe and the deepest economic slump in the G7. It was a record of both calamitous misjudgment and corruption, as contracts worth hundreds of millions were funnelled to those with friends in high Tory places. He appointed useless ministers, several of whom became mired in scandal. And yet Johnson remained aloft, riding the warm air currents of consistent leads in the opinion polls.

                    <span>Ethical business tells customers awaiting turkeys, geese and other food to seek refunds from banks
The online ethical grocer Farmdrop has gone out of business a week before Christmas, leaving hundreds of customers who had ordered turkeys, geese and other festive food scrambling to find alternatives.
The company confirmed it had gone into administration and was “permanently closed”, so it would not be delivering any orders from Friday onwards. Those who have paid will have to approach their bank or card company to ask about getting their money back. Thursday was the final day of deliveries.

Coronavirus – latest updates

 Vaccines and high levels of prior exposure to coronavirus in South Africa appear to be protecting against the more severe symptoms seen in the previous three waves of the pandemic, according to the country’s health minister.
The suggestion that previous exposure to another variant of coronavirus – or vaccination – might provide protection from the Omicron variant echoes analysis by South African experts earlier this week that suggested prior exposure or vaccination gave a degree of protection from serious disease.

                    <span>Walk the Line attracted only 3 million viewers for its hyped launch episode on Sunday night
 It was billed as the programme that would revive Simon Cowell’s fortunes – but his new primetime television format, Walk the Line, has instead been comprehensively beaten in the ratings by the high-brow quizshow Only Connect.
The new ITV show began its six-night run on Sunday night, in the hope that the format could bring back the success of his now defunct The X-Factor. Instead, Walk the Line’s ratings have fallen off a cliff as Cowell struggled to recapture the combination of emotional backstory, audience excitement and musical appeal that gave him two decades of television success.

                    <span>It’s not the worst thing our prime minister has done, but it feels like he and his wife are trolling me by calling their child Romy
“I have a suggestion and I’m not sure you’re going to like it,” my wife said, one evening in 2016. I knew what was coming. My wife isn’t someone prone to suggesting we suddenly up sticks and move to Arkansas, or begin new careers in mime artistry. And we’d been talking about names for our imminent first child. Girls’ names had been a particular problem: we’d ended up with a rotating cast of names from Mad Men – Peggys and Bettys and the like – but weren’t fully convinced. I braced myself for a “Gertrude”.
“What about Romy?” she said. Instantly, I loved it. The name’s roots are basically a Germanic twist on the Latin name Rosemary, but it seems to be more popular in France these days. My wife had been following the rather glam daughter of the editor of French Vogue on Instagram, who called her own daughter Romy. As it turned out, I’d recently done a phone interview with Romy from the xx and was struck by how lovely she’d been to chat to.

At Christmas, the last thing you want is to spend ages mixing cocktails when there’s so much else on your plate, which is why a little forward planning goes a long way. This drink is designed for ease and speed on the big day next weekend, and takes inspiration from the bitter aperitivi of southern Italy and Sicily, and from the blood oranges that grow there and are just coming into season now. By layering the fresh fruit on top of Campari, the traditional spritz is elevated to something multidimensional and fresh.

Frank Thomson* has been a social worker for more than a decade, but describes a short stint in Bradford council’s child safeguarding team as “without exaggerating, the scariest place I’ve ever worked in”.
This week, the spotlight has turned to the troubled social work department after the murder of Star Hobson, a 16-month-old toddler, who was beaten to death by her mother’s partner last September. On Wednesday, Savannah Brockhill, 28, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder; Frankie Smith, 20, Star’s mother, received an eight-year sentence for causing or allowing her death.

Large US companies are now pulling back on plans to return to in-person work in light of the Omicron variant’s rapid spread across America.
Employers planning to call remote workers back into the office in the new year are now pausing those efforts, and they are wary of setting new return dates only to push them back once again in the face of continued uncertainty and risks from the pandemic.

                    <span>A shortcut to delicious: buy in the pastry, fruit and mincemeat, and all you have to do is whip up a creamy frangipane. It’s super-adaptable, too
I’m known as the feeder of my friendship group, so it’s not uncommon for friends to pop round at short notice and just stay for dinner. And what sort of host would I be if I didn’t offer dessert? I love having a few shortcut puddings up my sleeve, and this one is great for the festive season. Using shop-bought puff pastry and a jar of good-quality mincemeat, all you need to do is mix together a frangipane and you’ve got a pretty impressive dessert. It’s super flexible, too, so use whatever you’ve got in: switch the apples for pears, say, add some chopped nuts or mix cocoa powder into the frangipane.

Members of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) have elected stalwart rightwinger Friedrich Merz as their designated new leader, as the conservative party seeks a new direction in opposition following the departure of Angela Merkel.
Merz, who has twice come second to centrist candidates in previous leadership races, won a surprise majority in the ballot, beating Merkel’s former chief of staff Helge Braun and foreign policy specialist Norbert Röttgen with 62% of the vote, thus eliminating the need for a run-off vote.

                    <span>The Liberal Democrat triumph in this week’s byelection is a damning verdict on Boris Johnson’s leadership
Byelection earthquakes don’t come much bigger than North Shropshire. The result – the former 23,000 Conservative majority overturned into a 6,000-vote win for the new Liberal Democrat MP Helen Morgan – is a bombshell for Boris Johnson, a wake-up call for the Conservative party and a life-enhancing triumph for the Lib Dems. It is also, perhaps, a sign that party politics is emerging from a period largely defined by the Brexit referendum of 2016, with tactical anti-Conservative voting now playing an increasingly important role.
Thursday’s 34% swing to the Lib Dems was spectacular by any yardstick. The Tory share of the vote collapsed by 31 percentage points, almost a modern record. This enabled Ed Davey’s party to come from a distant third place 10% share in 2019 to reach 47%. That surge produced the biggest Conservative to Lib Dem swing since the Christchurch byelection in 1993. Back then, the Lib Dem win was a damning verdict on a Conservative government’s economic competence. The verdict in North Shropshire is no less damning; but this one was focused squarely on the prime minister’s own abject performance and lack of integrity.

Russia has put forward a highly contentious list of security guarantees it says it wants the west to agree to in order to lower tensions in Europe and defuse the crisis over Ukraine, including many elements that have already been ruled out.
The demands include a ban on Ukraine entering Nato and a limit to the deployment of troops and weapons to Nato’s eastern flank, in effect returning Nato forces to where they were stationed in 1997, before an eastward expansion.

How alcohol and resentment turned Thomas Schreiber to murder

An aspiring artist has been found guilty of murdering one of the UK’s wealthiest landowners and attempting to murder his own mother while being locked down with them at their Dorset mansion because of Covid.
Thomas Schreiber, 35, attacked Sir Richard Sutton, 83, in his study and followed the multimillionaire upstairs to deliver the fatal blows as he tried to call for help.

                    <span>Humiliation upon humiliation is being piled on to the prime minister right now. Could a leadership contest be next?
Like me, you probably cannot BELIEVE that after hubris comes nemesis. If only there’d been some clue to this in all that Ancient Greek stuff Boris Johnson is forever wanging on about.
Anyway. The prime minister woke this morning in a pre-title sequence set in a silent bedroom. We see the detritus of many discarded lateral flow tests. We see something nasty on the bedsheets. (Less of a horse’s head, more of a Kendall Roy special.) We see a couple of rats slink out of his hair and think: Christ, if that’s what’s front-facing, the picture in his attic must now be technically classed as a biological weapon. Suddenly, the eerie silence is punctured. Ambulance sirens rend the air outside, while in the bedroom, multiple phones start ringing. Somewhere in the house, a baby begins screaming, while the frozen expression on the prime minister’s face simply says: “What just happened?!”

Having just the right words to explain what’s happening keeps you from feeling, well, crazy.
When the world learned of the passing of bell hooks, the renowned feminist, public intellectual, author, and professor on Wednesday, at her home in Berea, Kentucky, it was the value and accessibility of her words that resonated with Black women, whose understanding of themselves and their own work was transformed by hooks.

                    <span>He may be best known for bringing children’s books by Roald Dahl and Michael Rosen to vivid life, but a new documentary reveals the more serious side to illustrator’s career
Quentin Blake’s ascent to national treasure status has been fuelled by a 70-year career as an illustrator, most prominently of children’s books, and works by one writer in particular. His distinctive and revelatory conjuring of Roald Dahl’s world is one of the glories of late-20th century illustration, but it has sometimes masked other aspects of a remarkable career that’s been about a lot more than just the genius misanthrope of Great Missenden.
A new BBC documentary, Quentin Blake: The Drawing of My Life, allows for a wider appreciation, opening as it does with the 89-year-old illustrator confronted by 30ft of empty canvas and an invitation to fill it with an artwork that tells the story of his creative life. The broad brush of biography is soon filled in: his 1930s upbringing in suburban Sidcup, south-east London, from where Blake first got his work published in Punch while still at school; his decision to read English at Cambridge rather than going to art school; his 60s career as an in-demand illustrator (his Penguin paperback jackets for the likes of Kingsley Amis’s Lucky Jim have an attractively louche appeal); and as an author himself, most notably A Drink of Water, made with the writer and longtime friend and collaborator, John Yeoman.

                    <span>Should a polymath professor be expected to defer to a politician on public health guidance?
Conservative MPs have been taking out their frustration on England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, for what they see as his promotion of “lockdown by stealth”. Chief among them is Joy Morrissey, who said Whitty should “defer” to politicians like her.
In a now deleted tweet, Morrissey, who is on the government payroll as a parliamentary aide, said: “Perhaps the covid unelected public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of parliament and the prime minister have decided. I know it’s difficult to remember but this is not how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state.”

HSBC will pay a £63.9m fine after UK regulators found that it had allowed customers to make transactions worth millions or even billions of pounds without being checked for money laundering – including on one occasion leaving out the whole of Wales from monitoring.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK’s banking regulator, issued the punishment on Friday after finding “serious weaknesses” across HSBC’s automated systems used to monitor hundreds of millions of transactions a month to identify possible criminal activity.

                    <span>It was the divorce that gripped Britain, involving photographs of the Duchess of Argyll performing oral sex. But, says the writer of the BBC’s new drama, the woman behind the headlines was unfairly vilified
‘Here’s the thing,” says Sarah Phelps, talking about the Duchess of Argyll. “The first time I heard of her, she was referred to as The Blowjob Duchess.” The screenwriter has made this duchess, Margaret of Argyll, the heroine of A Very British Scandal, a new BBC drama starring Claire Foy and Paul Bettany as the aristos whose divorce transfixed the nation in 1963.
Thanks to a censorious judge, the vile behaviour of the duke, a series of photographs showing the duchess performing fellatio on an unidentified man and her own altruistic, if high-handed, refusal to defend herself, the sexual ins and outs of this separation are a matter of incredibly detailed historical record. “It was,” says Phelps,” all about, ‘Who’s the man?’, ‘Who’s the headless man in the photos?’, ‘How many men did she fuck?’, ‘Who was she blowing?’ And I almost thought, ‘I actually don’t give a shit. I want to know about her. I want to know who she was.’ So the blowjob matters to me in one way. But it matters less in the prurient sense of needing to know who was on the other end of that erection.”

                    <span>In the BBC TV series, treasured objects are restored to their former glory. It’s a vision of how life ought to be
Nothing but good happens in The Repair Shop, a thoroughly commendable television show in which pleasant men and women bring beloved but damaged objects to a team of equally pleasant craftspeople who will repair them and make them like new. At the start of every show we see an ancient thatched barn as Bill Paterson’s reassuring voice sets the scene. This is a place where “precious and faded treasures are restored to their former glory”; where “heritage craft skills passed down the generations” are exercised; a place where, not least, the conversation between owners and restorers “unlocks the story” inside every object.
Inside the barn, the craftspeople are already at work: sandpapering, sawing, sewing, stuffing, burnishing, painting, soldering, hammering, chiselling. The barn is real enough. It was built in around 1700 for a farm in Hampshire and relocated 40 years ago to the Weald and Downland Living Museum in West Sussex, where the series is filmed. But as real barns go, the Repair Shop is unusually smart, its wooden frame robust, its reed-thatch immaculate, and its interior beautifully lit.

The Sami, the only indigenous people left in Europe, have more than 100 different words for snow. From seaŋáš, a fluffy, grainy snow that moves easily, to tjaevi, flakes that stick together and are hard to dig, the names are based on its texture, depth, density, and the harsh conditions of the Arctic winter.
But the Sami of Sápmi, who are traditionally fishers, trappers and reindeer herders, do not yet have a word for what they are seeing more often on the ground.

                    <span>With his teenage neuroses and gawky vulnerability, Spidey isn’t your ordinary superhero, but despite the dodgy wrist action he still resonates with armies of fans 
Not a spider – and not a man – but the most powerful teenage kid in pop-culture history. Spider-Man is the lonely, sensitive, adolescent underdog whose high-school miseries and humiliations, combined with his secret superheroic triumphs, have been comic-book crack for generations of fascinated fans and a gateway drug to the Marvel world itself.
He first appeared in Marvel Comics almost 60 years ago: the orphaned young science prodigy, Peter Parker, bitten by a radioactive spider at an educational exhibit. (Like Godzilla, Spider-Man is a product of the nuclear age.) He acquires the proportionate strength of a spider, a tingly “spider sense” for danger, and the ability to climb up walls. He designs his own body-hugging web-motif costume and web-shooting wrist modules and becomes a superhero, battling people such as the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. But he is somehow unable to reveal his secret to his high-school crush Mary Jane Watson and, as humble Parker, gets bullied by the high-school jock Flash Thompson who – ironically – fan-worships Spider-Man. So Spider-Man’s victories coexist with despair and depression: he fails to save his Uncle Ben, killed by a street criminal, and his entire superhero career is driven by that primal scene of failure and guilt – a Rosebud of wretchedness.

                    <span>Analysis: a series of self-inflicted reversals is steadily undermining the prime minister’s hold on power
It has been two years since Boris Johnson shattered Labour’s “red wall” of northern seats to secure the Conservative party’s biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher’s 1987 victory.
But while the prime minister was lauded by the Tory faithful in the months after that result, and was helped by a successful vaccine programme to weather questions about the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic, a succession of sometimes self-inflicted reversals has put his position in peril.

                    <span>Analysis: If the spread continues at this rate, a small proportion of Covid hospitalisations is a serious matter
With the booster programme at full tilt across the UK, immunity against Covid is rising – so it is perhaps not surprising that the concern shown by experts over the steep rise in Omicron infections has left some bemused.
 For while the new variant is believed to dodge Covid vaccines to some degree, it is thought the jabs still offer good protection against severe disease – particularly after a booster. And greater levels of immunity mean a lower ratio of hospitalisations to cases – something we have seen before in the UK, where about 22% of cases in those aged 65 and older ended up in hospital in early 2021, when Alpha was dominant but few had received a vaccine, compared with about 6% after the vaccine rollout was well under way.

The dining year began somewhat hopelessly: shutters down, tables up. There were times during February 2021, which seemed to last at least 77 days, when I wondered if Britain would ever eat, drink and be merry again. Before my mother’s sparse, heavily restricted cremation, my brother and I kicked about an idea of holding an illegal wake at the drive-thru McDonald’s just off junction 44 of the M6. It was the only place open and serving, and besides, Mam always enjoyed a cheeseburger and fries more than anywhere fancy we took her.
We didn’t, in the end, because breaking the rules on mourning wouldn’t have been fair. If strangers had passed by and spotted us in a car park, all dressed in black and holding Big Macs and strawberry milkshakes, they might have said, “Why didn’t we think of that?” and been rightfully furious.

                    <span>After you’ve written your memoir, publishers these days want anyone famous to write crime novels. We put 10 of the most well-known in the dock
The view that everyone has one book in them is disproved by celebrities, who now tend to produce at least two – a memoir and then, courting publishing’s most lucrative market, a crime or thriller novel. The autumn lists include suspense stories from both a former president and a secretary of state of the US, a former UK home secretary, three well-known British TV journalists and a leading quizshow host.
In Britain, the celebrity mystery genre began with Dick Francis’s Dead Cert (1962), and continued with Jeffrey Archer’s Not A Penny More, Not A Penny Less (1976).

Also in a different category are Tony Parsons and Lynne Truss, whose recent series of crime novels - latest instalments Your Neighbour’s Wife and Murder By Milk Bottle – followed many novels in other genres. And, while the current culture secretary Nadine Dorries has published much fiction, she has not yet turned to crime.

The bad news is that, at the last minute, my interview with Javier Bardem is changed from being a face-to-face encounter to one conducted by the less risky means of video chat (damn you, Omicron!) But the good news is this means I get to snoop around Bardem’s home in Madrid, where he Zooms me from, and which he shares with his wife, the actor Penélope Cruz, and their two children, Leonardo, 10, and Luna, eight. OK, I don’t actually see the whole house, but he does give me a panoramic view of his study while his kids shout and play outside.
“You can see my little bookcase here,” Bardem says, picking up his laptop and giving me the grand tour. “And my map of the world. It’s very chaotic.”

                    <span>The singer swears by it, it’s all over Instagram, and it has boosted the worldwide rosé market. What is the £19 bottle’s secret?


A bag of Babybels, a bowl of leftover dal – even by civilian standards, there is rarely anything glamorous about the contents of my fridge. So it is with a pleasurable shiver of surprise that every time I have opened my fridge over the past week, a bottle of blush-pink Provençal rosé has been casting a rosy glow over my parmesan rinds and Tupperware. Because this is not just any wine; this is Whispering Angel, Adele’s favourite, and the most talked-about tipple of the year.

                    <span>Yippie-ki-yay! Here’s your ultimate festive film guide, from masterful classics and family favourites to starry new movies like Don’t Look Up and Last Train to Christmas
On a train back to Nottingham on Christmas Eve 1985, Stringfellow-esque club owner Tony Towers (Michael Sheen) discovers that if he moves between coaches he can visit his past or future life. With his business and relationship with his brother Roger (Cary Elwes) in peril, Tony tries to rewrite history in his favour, only to make things worse for everyone. A smart, twisty reboot of A Christmas Carol from Julian Kemp, with Sheen sporting a series of wonderfully cringe-worthy hairstyles and clothes.

For many regional theatres, their Christmas pantomime is the biggest show of the year. Its particularly British mixture of slapstick humour, double entendres and gender switching continues to delight audiences across generations.

West End shows are postponing and even cancelling their Christmas shows as cast members and theatre staff fall ill.
Nosheen Iqbal visits the cast of Sleeping Beauty at the Cube theatre in Corby, Northamptonshire, during their rehearsals for a show still hoping to welcome a full audience for its opening night tonight.

                    <span>A new exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria – Bark Ladies: Eleven Artists from Yirrkala – celebrates the NGV’s collection of more than 70 bark paintings and larrakitj (painted hollow poles) by female artists from the Buku-Larrŋgay Mulka Centre in north-east Arnhem Land. Five of the 11 artists are living and continue to work out of the Yolŋu-run art centre.
The works explore Yolŋu conceptions of the universe, fire, totems, spiritual beings and animals as well as Australian politics. Traditionally, Yolŋu artists use materials collected from the land, mixing natural pigments, ochre and sand with traditional and synthetic binders to create paint. In recent years, some Yolŋu artists have begun mixing natural materials with discarded printer cartridges to create technicolour pigments.

Bark Ladies: Eleven Artists from Yirrkala runs at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne until 25 April 2022

                    <span>From lip-syncing in east London gay bars to posing for Italian Vogue, the star of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK has defined their own style with unabashed flair
The most important lesson Bimini Bon Boulash has learned is that life is yours to define how you wish: “As long as you’re not hurting anyone, I think we should be able to exist as ourselves,” they tell me over the phone from their flat in London. “When it comes to how you want to be and how you want to express yourself, know that there are no rules. I feel like my personal style one day could be me getting vaccinated in a football kit and the next day I’m wearing Valentino. One day I’m relaxing with a cup of tea, the next I’m full glam with a martini cocktail in hand. There are no rules that I follow or boxes that I tick.”
Rejecting norms is fundamental to Bimini’s art, and since appearing on the second series of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK their non-conformist attitude has endeared them not just to queer people worldwide but to fans from all walks of life. In the UK, disrupting the “cis-tem” with a genderless approach to life and fashion, releasing a self-help book A Drag Queen’s Guide to Life, and advocating for the LGBTQ+ community – especially trans people – with true passion, has cemented their status as a queer national treasure.

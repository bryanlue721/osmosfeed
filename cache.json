But this was a hammering in which the losing team deserved praise having shown character and quality in the second half, dominating possession and territory and securing the goal their efforts deserved. Yet as the home fans cheered so did those in the away end having not just seen a win by Manchester City but another statement of intent.\nFour days after dismantling Club Brugge in the Champions League, City were at it again, this time getting the job done in the first half, scoring three times, through Ilkay Gündogan and Phil Foden, twice, during a devastating 18-minute spell. Their approach play was typically quick, slick and accurate and, having secured a fourth goal via Riyad Mahrez’s stoppage-time strike, they climb to second. City will drop back a place should Liverpool beat Manchester United on Sunday but what the champions made abundantly clear here is that when it comes to this season’s title race, they are not going away.\n Continue reading...",

To loud applause, the UK government says it wants to implement the most far-reaching web regulation of any western democracy.

Is it just a weird fad, or could it help people with anxiety and depression?\nWhen I was five years old something strange happened. After a busy afternoon finger-painting and running around, we were gathered by our teacher on the classroom carpet to listen to a story. I can’t remember which book she read – only that she began to do so in a soft voice, pitched somewherejust above a whisper.\nSuddenly, a euphoric, tingling sensation started at the crown of my head and then travelled down my neck and back in waves. The more she read, the stronger the feeling became. I glanced at my friends, expecting to see them in a similar state of rapture, but they weren’t. So I kept the feeling a secret and soon forgot all about it.\n Continue reading...",

Set in the near future as American society is unravelling, it tells the story of a young black student and her neighbours fleeing Charlottesville, Virginia, pursued by violent white supremacists and taking refuge in Monticello, home of US president Thomas Jefferson. The book, which the New York Times called “a masterly feat”, is now being turned into a film for Netflix. Johnson lives in Charlottesville with her husband and son.\nThe apocalyptic scenario you create in the book has clear roots in the American present – there are terrible storms, power failures and racial violence. Was it hard to imagine or unnervingly easy?\nIt was extremely easy, because it was me nudging forward from the very real fears I had after 12 August 2017. That’s when Charlottesville experienced the deadly Unite the Right rally, where we had a public run-in with a certain type of extremism. All this was combined with worrying about equity, infrastructure and the environment.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Forgoing a particular style or era as influence, a fashion designer has created a cosy and colourful home in Paris\nWhen Célia Bernard and her husband Jean-Marie Castille found this two-bedroom Parisian apartment directly on the Right Bank of the Seine, they were sure about one thing: they didn’t want to paint it white. Instead, they opted for a khaki in the entry hall and dark chocolate brown doors. They also painted the living room in a deep yellow that she refers to as “curry”.\nColour is very much at the heart of the ebullient Bernard’s latest professional venture. After 22 years working as a broker in finance, she set up a fashion brand, Love and Let Dye, with her friend, Marine Vignes, who is best known in France as a TV weather presenter. The idea came to them during a trip to Bali in 2020, where they decided to have some clothes made for themselves. “We hired a scooter and went down little alleyways hunting for a tailor and for women who worked with the tie-and-dye technique,” recalls Bernard. “For me, it’s like Proust’s madeleine. Tie-and-dye takes me back to my youth when I sold jeans on Venice Beach in Los Angeles.”\n Continue reading...",

She is the former Facebook employee who revealed that the company knew about the harm that some of its products, especially Instagram, were causing but did little or nothing about them because it prioritised growth and revenue above all else.\nA good CV is essential to establish your street cred and Haugen ticks all the Silicon Valley boxes. A degree in electrical engineering? Check. An MBA from Harvard? Check. Specialised in algorithmic management? Check. Experience with, and knowledge of, ranking algorithms at a number of tech companies? Check (Google, Pinterest, Yelp). And of course you’ll have held down a substantial position in the company about which you are blowing the whistle. Again, Haugen ticks that box: at Facebook, she was the lead product manager on the civic misinformation team, which dealt with issues of democracy and misinformation; she later worked on counterespionage.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Uncanny and creepy, premonitions that turn out to be authentic can feel profound. But is there science to explain them?\nAround seven years ago, Garrett, was in a local Pizza Hut with his friends, having a day so ordinary that it is cumbersome to describe. He was 16 – or thereabouts – and had been told by teachers to go around nearby businesses and ask for gift vouchers that the school could use as prizes in a raffle. There were five other teenagers with Garrett, and they’d just finished speaking to the restaurant manager when suddenly, out of nowhere, Garrett’s his body was flooded with shock. He felt cold and clammy and had an “overwhelming sense that something had happened”. He desperately tried to stop himself crying in front of his peers.\n“It was like I’d just been told something terrible,” the now 23-year-old from the southwest of England says (his name has been changed on his request). “I couldn’t tell you exactly what it was, but I just knew something had happened.” Garrett returned home and tried to distract himself from a feeling he describes as grief. The phone rang. His mum answered it. A few hours earlier – around the time Garrett was in the restaurant – his grandfather had died from a sudden heart attack while on a cruise.\n Continue reading...",

I thought the whole social media thing might be really positive.”\nSix years on, as Kuennssberg appears to have come to the end of her tenure, she might have been careful what she wished for. The voices outside Westminster she has mostly been hearing are those toxic tones that have become the white noise of our fractured public life.\n Continue reading...",

In the cider apple orchard and grass pastures below, younger hedges shoot off towards a fast-flowing trout stream.\nHistory has come full circle in Blackmore Farm, which nestles in the foothills of the Quantocks in Somerset. The owner, Ian Dyer, remembers helping his father, who arrived as a tenant farmer in the 1950s, grub out old hedges in the 1960s and 1970s. But – like increasing numbers of landowners – he has hired a hedgelayer to bring back his hedges to provide habitats for wildlife, capture carbon and slow water pouring off fields into rivers.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "A stellar cast enliven the director’s uneven three-story anthology featuring a student protest, an insane artist and a heist thriller\nThe films of Wes Anderson, with their intricately layered details and fanatically meticulous design, almost invariably reward a second viewing. That is certainly the case with his latest, The French Dispatch, a showily starry portmanteau picture that takes as a jumping-off point the final issue of a supplement magazine for the fictional Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun newspaper. But given that on a first viewing I found it to be among the most punchable films I have ever seen, the initial bar was lower than with some of Anderson’s other pictures.\nThe problem with the anthology structure – the film is made of three discrete stories, each based on a feature article by one of the magazine’s star writers, plus a brief scene-setting travelogue that digs into the insalubrious corners of the town of Ennui-sur-Blasé – is that it’s almost inevitably uneven. And however engaging the film’s final story is – the most satisfying by no small margin; a food review turned heist thriller narrated by and starring Jeffrey Wright at his most mellifluous and charming – patience will be sorely tried by the segment that comes before it.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The comic actor and writer on his new sitcom about community service, sharing Christopher Walken’s omelette and portraying a serial killer\nStephen Merchant, 46, is a writer, producer, director and comic actor who rose to fame in 2001 with The Office, about life at a paper supply company in Slough. Created by Merchant and his former XFM co-presenter Ricky Gervais, the awards-festooned series spawned a US version starring Steve Carell, and is credited with prompting a new wave of comedy series that dispensed with laughter tracks and punchlines in favour of a mockumentary style. The pair followed up The Office with Extras, in which Merchant played incompetent agent to Gervais’s struggling actor, amid a feast of celebrity cameos. In 2013 he wrote and starred in the HBO sitcom Hello Ladies, a series based on his standup routine and which followed an Englishman in Los Angeles and his failed attempts at dating. Elsewhere, he has worked variously as a DJ on BBC 6 Music, a podcaster and voiceover artist, and has appeared in films including Hot Fuzz and Jojo Rabbit.\nMerchant’s new six-part series, The Outlaws, co-created with Elgin James, follows the fortunes of seven strangers doing community service in Merchant’s former hometown of Bristol. Characters include Darren Boyd’s reactionary businessman, Clare Perkins’ diehard activist, Eleanor Tomlinson’s spoilt influencer, Merchant’s sad-sack solicitor – and Christopher Walken in his first role in a British comedy, as a career criminal fresh out of prison.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Increasingly, authoritarians are likening ‘genderism’ to ‘communism’ and ‘totalitarianism’\nIn June, the Hungarian parliament voted overwhelmingly to eliminate from public schools all teaching related to “homosexuality and gender change”, associating LGBTQI rights and education with pedophilia and totalitarian cultural politics. In late May, Danish MPs passed a resolution against “excessive activism” in academic research environments, including gender studies, race theory, postcolonial and immigration studies in their list of culprits. In December 2020, the supreme court in Romania struck down a law that would have forbidden the teaching of “gender identity theory” but the debate there rages on. Trans-free spaces in Poland have been declared by transphobes eager to purify Poland of corrosive cultural influences from the US and the UK. Turkey’s withdrawal from the Istanbul convention in March sent shudders through the EU, since one of its main objections was the inclusion of protections for women and children against violence, and this “problem” was linked to the foreign word, “gender”.\nThe attacks on so-called “gender ideology” have grown in recent years throughout the world, dominating public debate stoked by electronic networks and backed by extensive rightwing Catholic and evangelical organizations. Although not always in accord, these groups concur that the traditional family is under attack, that children in the classroom are being indoctrinated to become homosexuals, and that “gender” is a dangerous, if not diabolical, ideology threatening to destroy families, local cultures, civilization, and even “man” himself.\n Continue reading...",

That is certainly evident through the rise of exchanges on platforms such as Olio, Facebook Marketplace and Nextdoor, where people happily take their neighbours’ unwanted goods off their hands. Sometimes items are new or as good as new; sometimes they are a piece of furniture to upcycle and breathe new life into. \nFrom saving money to helping the planet, many people turn to volunteer-run online communities focused on goods that would otherwise go to landfill, rather than head to Ikea. Searches for the term “Freecycle” have increased 22% from July 2018 to July 2021, while the number of people Googling “where can I find free stuff?” shot up 800% over the same period, according to the data provider SEMrush.

Enter Steve Jobs, whose new device created a digital music market – and made Apple into a titan\nIn 2001, the record business was in freefall due to digital piracy, and the best way out of this accelerating crisis came in the shape of a white device the size of a deck of cards. The iPod, launched 20 years ago this week, was also how Apple’s Steve Jobs was able to prey on a failing business in order to avenge his own past failures – exiled between 1985 and 1997 from the company he co-founded – by turning Apple into the most profitable company in history.\nBefore the iPod lifeline arrived in October 2001, record labels were in full panic mode. In its annual report for 2001, record company trade body IFPI called it “a turbulent” year, blaming filesharing and CD burning for a revenue slump. Jay Berman was chief exective of IFPI at the time and calls the scale of filesharing then “a crisis of momentous proportions” for record labels. “It really was,” he says, “a foreign invasion.”\n Continue reading...",

But the best conversations also have a timeless quality, taking you back into the realm of memory, propelling you forward toward your hopes and dreams. Sharing stories reminds you that you’re not alone – and maybe helps you understand yourself a little bit better.\nWhen Bruce and I first sat down in the summer of 2020 to record Renegades: Born in the USA, we didn’t know how our conversations would turn out. What I did know was that Bruce was a great storyteller, a bard of the American experience – and that we both had a lot on our minds, including some fundamental questions about the troubling turn our country had taken. A historic pandemic showed no signs of abating. Americans everywhere were out of work. Millions had just taken to the streets to protest the murder of George Floyd, and the then occupant of the White House seemed intent not on bringing people together but on tearing down some of the basic values and institutional foundations of our democracy.\n Continue reading...",

As Cop26 nears, here’s why it’s time to rise up\n• The good fight: the climate activists risking everything\nThe first time I was ever arrested, I was picked up for smuggling drugs into the US from Canada. They were vitamin pills, but that didn’t seem to matter to the police officer in Cleveland, who mentioned that his orders had come from the Nixon White House. It was 1970. I had just started a campus speaking tour protesting against the Vietnam war, and was under surveillance by the National Security Agency. I raised my fist for the mugshot, and after a night in jail, they let me go.\nI think the idea was to discredit my opposition to the war, and maybe get my speeches cancelled. Instead, students turned up in their thousands. My first arrest wasn’t for an act of civil disobedience, exactly, but the lesson I took away from that surreal experience was just how powerful it can be to set your ideals against the machinery of the state. Half a century later, it still works.

But the world must follow the science\nThere should be no surprise about leaked documents showing governments lobbying hard against clauses in an upcoming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that they regard as detrimental to their interests. Ever since the start of the UN process aimed at preventing unchecked global heating (known as Cop, short for Conference of the Parties), countries have sought to protect their own industries, economies and people – particularly the fossil fuel businesses that have powered capitalist development since the Industrial Revolution.\nLast time the nations met, in Madrid in 2019, progress was scuppered by a wall of resistance with President Trump perched on top. The hope was that with Trump gone, and a US administration in place that recognises the need for action, such blockages could be overcome. This remains the aim in the run-up to the conference opening in Glasgow next weekend. Given the warnings from scientists, who are unequivocal about the dangers, there is no rational alternative than to persist with the attempt at global climate governance that the Cop represents. As the British Treasury acknowledged in a review published this week, the cost of inaction will be higher than the cost of action.\n Continue reading...",

But if you are only joining now, because England and the other supposed “big guns” are playing, you have missed a week of extraordinary action, with eight less prestigious cricketing countries fighting for places in the so-called “Super 12s” stage of the tournament. \nThe eight who contested the preliminary stages were a motley bunch: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Ireland, all of which are Test-playing countries of relatively recent vintage; Scotland, which aspires to Test status and won a famous victory against England in a 50-over match in 2018; the Netherlands, where cricket has been played for two centuries and which beat England at Lord’s in the 2009 World Cup; and three true minnows – Oman, Namibia and Papua New Guinea. Namibia’s win over the Netherlands on Wednesday was in its own way as big a shock as that unexpected victory by the Dutch over England in 2009.

The climate emergency is a planet-wide threat, at a time when universalism and international solidarity are in retreat.

Sign up here\n\nMy favourite documentary of the past decade – by some margin – is OJ: Made in America, Ezra Edelman’s epic account of the rise and fall of OJ Simpson. Those who haven’t seen it (and you really, really should see it – the whole thing is available on the iPlayer right now) will primarily remember it as the longest ever “film”, at nearly eight hours, to win an Academy Award. Its best documentary victory – though hugely well-deserved on one level – was in another way a bit iffy: made as a five-part series for ESPN, it received a tiny theatrical release in the US that qualified it for Oscars consideration.\nThe Academy have since tightened up their rules to bar multipart documentaries from the best documentary category and, well, fair enough, really! Made in America is clearly a TV series, and a really great example of what you can do with that format. It is sprawling and comprehensive, bouncing between styles – at one minute a sport documentary, the next a forensic true crime series, then a rumination on racial politics in late 20th-century America – and using its initially narrow focus as a means of exploring a whole host of other topics: race, fame, misogyny, police brutality, the media, professional sport, even the flow of information itself. It felt like a thrilling new update of the documentary, timed perfectly to the rise of streaming.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The Netflix hit is as fantastical as it is violent – but underpinning its macabre story of impoverished contestants risking their lives for money is a real crisis of personal debt in Korea. Why has it resonated all over the world?\nA high-concept, ultraviolent South Korean thriller that was rejected by Seoul TV executives for a decade might seem like an unlikely candidate for the most popular series ever to be shown on Netflix. But by now you probably know that Squid Game – in which hundreds of down-on-their-luck contestants play a series of children’s games for a vast cash prize in the knowledge that if they lose they will be killed on the spot – has defied that analysis and become a worldwide phenomenon, a lightning rod for debates over depictions of violence, and an instant classic costume option for Halloween.\nUnderneath all that hype, though, is a story that resonates deeply in South Korea – where levels of personal debt are now equivalent to 105% of GDP – and has struck a chord around the world. In Rachel Humphreys’ final episode as presenter, the Seoul-based culture journalist Nemo Kim explains the connection between the TV show and a crisis founded on a system that makes taking out a loan as easy as buying a cup of coffee.

Temporarily at least. There had been a suspicion that the many fine words that had been spoken in tribute to David Amess on Monday might have been quickly forgotten by the time prime minister’s questions came round.

There were still many social media platforms on which violent and extremist content was posted: could the government commit to giving the bill its second reading by the end of the year? If so, it would have Labour’s backing. Boris tried to think of a reason why not, but quickly realised he was cornered and promised to give the bill a pre-Christmas nudge.\n Continue reading...",

Facebook’s quarrel with the UK competition watchdog offered a near-perfect illustration of corporate arrogance and entitlement in action.\nThe case is extraordinary for the fact that the stakes were so low: Facebook’s $400m (£290m) purchase last year of Giphy, a software firm that specialises in Gifs, the essential visual aid for social media meme-peddlers, can barely have registered on Mark Zuckerberg’s radar. The purchase price equated to less than 0.5% of Facebook’s global revenues.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The puppet’s journey from Turkey to the UK charmed audiences – but also discomfited them. And that’s the point\nThis week, a 3.5-metre tall puppet called Little Amal landed at Folkestone. From there she is travelling to London, Coventry and finally Manchester. Since July she has taken an 8,000km journey through Turkey, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France, following the route that a child migrant from Syria might. Her journey provides “an opportunity for people to be sympathetic and imagine what it would be like to be her”, David Lan, one of the project’s organisers, has said.\nAs a piece of theatre Little Amal is an extraordinary thing: incredibly simple, almost naive in conception, and yet utterly epic in execution. Hers (somehow it is impossible to say “its”) has been a tremendous, and deeply touching, journey – an intervention in the long and difficult debate about refugees that powerfully foregrounds simple human empathy rather than policy points or dry arguments. Along the way she has been greeted joyfully by crowds, sent letters by Belgian school pupils, blessed by the pope and, on Sunday, will celebrate her birthday at the V&A in London with local children and a great deal of cake. But there has been a darker side, too: she has also been pelted with stones, protested against, and denied access to a village of Greek monasteries. Little Amal, as a work of art, has been welcomed by audiences, and delighted them. She has also discomfited them, even repulsed them. In other words, as Lan has pointed out, her presence has allowed a kind of re-enactment of the attitudes displayed to real refugees.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The government must take a more cautious and focused approach to a pandemic that is not over\nPost-lockdown Britain is sailing dangerously close to the wind. Wednesday’s tally of 49,139 cases is far higher than equivalent figures being recorded elsewhere in Europe. Hospitalisations and deaths are on the rise, and one in five intensive care beds is currently occupied by a Covid patient. The NHS – struggling to deal with a waiting list of 6 million people – has warned that if the escalation in cases is not checked, invidious decisions will have to be taken about priorities. Exhausted staff, too few in number, say they are on the cusp of being overwhelmed. And winter has yet to begin.\nGiven that darkening context, Sajid Javid’s first Covid press conference did very little to reassure. Mr Javid’s announcement that two new anti-viral drugs, which reduce the severity of Covid infections, may be available in months, was very good news. But as the NHS Confederation calls for urgent measures to prevent an imminent crisis, it was also a distraction. On the issue of the day, the health secretary flatly rejected the idea that the pressures on the NHS were becoming unsustainable, despite admitting that Covid cases could rise as high as 100,000 a day. He offered instead a pep talk to the public, urging it to remember to act cautiously when mixing.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "There’s a certain flair to director Adam Randall’s Collateral-with-blood-sucking caper but not enough to disguise a reheated script\nThere’s a frustrating dissonance to the pre-Halloween Netflix horror Night Teeth, slick packaging belying rotten innards. While the director, Adam Randall, finds inventive ways to break out of the drab Netflix visual template we’ve all grown weary of, any flair he shows is dampened by a script that struggles to add anything to an undead subgenre that’s already been done to death. It’s all bark, no bite.\nIn first-time writer Brent Dillon’s graphic novel-adjacent universe, there is the age-old trope of the age-old truce between vampires and humans, rules that are agreed upon to maintain a certain equilibrium. In the Boyle Heights neighbourhood of Los Angeles, vampires aren’t allowed in without permission but as the film opens, a rebel mission is launched by Victor (Alfie Allen), tired of kowtowing to the human cattle. He starts a war against Jay (Raul Castillo), a mortal who upholds the law and hunts those who step out of line. Jay’s younger half-brother Benny (Love Simon’s Jorge Lendeborg Jr) finds himself caught in the middle when he takes over Jay’s chauffeur shift and is forced by two vampiric passengers (Lucy Fry and Debby Ryan), working with Victor, to drive them through the city as they destroy various vampire heads before the sun comes up.\n Continue reading...",

But it is also crucial to judge them for their fairness. We need to reduce total emissions as rapidly as possible – “fairness” at a macro level means protecting poorer countries that have done little to cause the problem, and those countries that have emitted the most overall, such as the UK, moving fastest. \nAt a more micro level, fairness is also vital. The move to net zero will lead to major changes across all aspects of UK society, and a lot of less well-off people are understandably worrying whether they can afford to cut their emissions. It’s essential to design policies so that this transition is fair for individuals and that no one is left behind. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also makes sense politically: if fairness is not baked in then people will resist change, and that reasonable resentment will be magnified and manipulated by those seeking to delay action for other reasons.\nRebecca Newsom is head of politics at Greenpeace UK\n Continue reading...",

He asked an expert he knew from his work in woodland conservation what wood his new kitchen should be built with. He was startled to get a sharp response: “If you really care, then don’t come to me asking which wood to use; ask yourself if you really need a new kitchen.” Point taken, but not much acted upon, by him, me or anyone else I’ve come across.\nI’m so sick of stuff. Some of it is stuff I really need or that is at least genuinely nice to have, but a good 70% is useless stuff. Clothes I’ll never wear, books I’ll never read, kitchen utensils I’ll never utilise. Items big and small that presumably felt essential the day I bought them but turned out to be quite the opposite. I suppose that as I get older the 70% figure will grow and grow until the morning of the day I shuffle off this mortal coil. At this point the percentage of stuff I own that is useless to me will stand at a nice round 100, because, of course, I won’t be able to take it with me. But what I will be able to do is leave it to my children to bump up the percentage of stuff useless to them that they own. And so it goes on.\nAdrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist\n Continue reading...",

Both before war was declared on Iraq, and also before Brexit was enacted, some 1 million people marched through the streets of London in opposition. These people were engaged, informed, enlightened folk from across the country, committed enough to march for policies that to them represented the right way forward, for Britain and the world. The governments of the day ignored them.\nThe consequences of the Iraq war and Brexit are now all too clear. We should not have made war; we should not have left Europe. As John Harris says: “People in the political mainstream – by which I chiefly mean Labour MPs – need to start loudly talking about Brexit … and what life outside Europe is doing to us.” Absolutely. I feel sure there are millions of voters desperate for Keir Starmer, the shadow cabinet and all Labour MPs, at every opportunity, to do exactly that. \nDavid Curtis \nSolihull, West Midlands\n Continue reading...",

Here, as there, the opposition fails spectacularly if it campaigns as separate parties. The last time the UK Conservative party won more votes than the combination of the other parties was in 1959. A substantial minority of voters always votes Conservative, but it has never been more than a minority. Long periods of uninterrupted Conservative rule are not necessary to rein in leftwing absurdities; instead, absurdities of the right become entrenched.\nThe UK government has moved further to the right than any previous Conservative administration and is doing long-term damage (5 million children growing up in poverty, for example). Because the opposition parties will not unite, the Conservatives are almost certain to win again. As in Hungary, they are reshaping the electoral system to bolster their chances. Who knows what damage yet more rightwing governments will do?\nJeremy Cushing \nExeter\n Continue reading...",

Given the sheer number of infected people, that just encourages complacency\nWhen the official inquiry into the Covid-19 crisis finally happens, the current phase of the pandemic will warrant as much scrutiny as any of the earlier ones. It’s surely the strangest and in some ways the most disturbing period of the pandemic so far, not least because there seems to be collective denial from the government and much of the public that we are still in a pandemic at all.\nSome statistics might help to correct any such fantasies. Since mid-August, as many people in the UK have been dying from Covid every two weeks as typically die directly from flu in a year: that’s 1,400 or so. The UK has one of the highest per capita infection rates in the world: four times higher than Germany, nine times higher than France, and 25 times higher than Spain.

Concetta Caristo starts by casting her mind back to high school\nMy earliest memory of something funny online was the Papa’s Boat meme. It’s a reference to a poem called The Old World that was featured on the 2010 School Certificate English test for Year 10 students. In 2010, Facebook was king and so was liking funny Facebook pages. They would come up in your newsfeed as “Concetta Caristo likes Standing naked on the porch waiting for google maps to take a picture” or “Concetta Caristo likes Carrying a fork in your pocket just in case someone has lasagna”.\nThe night after the first English exam, I’m awake scrolling my Facebook newsfeed when I start to see some of my classmates liking these pages about the poem I had JUST spent all morning reading and analysing. “Sarah likes That awkward moment when Papa keeps his boat.” I’m dying. “Bryony likes I throw my Papa in the air sometimes saying ayo, where’d my boat go?” My mind is exploding and I’m laughing alone in my bed as meme page after meme page rolls in. In that moment I was at one with every single Year 10 student in New South Wales. Do any other 1994 babies remember this? If you do reach out to me for God’s sake.\n Continue reading...",

By the time I left, moving back to Sydney during Covid, I could still pull off a sweet wave, even where the big boys surfed. At least on a good day. Surfing makes me feel powerful, connected and happy.\nStarting life again in Australia – a place so familiar, yet so foreign – was really hard. I found myself a boyfriend who gave me a sweet longboard for my birthday, but then we broke up. I was a mess: lonely, lost, stressed and sad. I tried to enrol friends who surfed to come out with me, but everyone was too busy with their robust lives of children and work. I tried to make friends on the beach, but surfers can be surprisingly solemn. I tried going alone and I found it too intimidating.\n Continue reading...",

I’m sure there must be rules: don’t take backhanders from galleries. Don’t get too intimate with artists, especially not dead ones.

He realised that lots of children were unable to come to his classes because the kit was too expensive, while at the same time others had stuff sitting unused in their wardrobes. He suggested to People and Work – the charity for which he was working – that it introduced a sportswear and equipment recycling scheme, which also removed some of the financial barriers to sport. The momentum built, it won national lottery funding, and Natasha Burnell started running Play It Again Sport in November 2019.\nBurnell loves her job, which involves lots of human interaction and plenty of rummaging around in her huge store room. Play It Again Sport is based in the Rhonda Valley, an ex-mining community with high levels of obesity, sickness and unemployment and lower levels of access to transport.

          "description": "The acclaimed Irish writer on writing short works, the Magdalene Laundries and her new hobby, horse training\nFor those who know and follow her work, a new Claire Keegan book is as rare and precious as a diamond in a coalmine. There have been just four of them over 22 years, and all are small, sharp and brilliant. Fortunately for an author so sparing with her output, those who know and follow her include an international array of literary connoisseurs, and many of the children passing through the Irish school system.\nEleven years have passed since her third published work – a standalone story, Foster – cemented her place as one of Ireland’s canonical writers, with a place on the leaving certificate syllabus. Foster is a gentle yarn about a small girl who is thrown upon the kindness of strangers while her mother gives birth to yet another baby. Her latest, Small Things Like These, is altogether darker and more ominous. It’s also longer, though pagination isn’t what separates the two. “To me,” says Keegan, “Foster isn’t a novel. It’s a long short story. And this is a novel, efficiently told. Unfortunately, this is often mistaken for what is condensed, and I have no time at all for what is condensed. I think something needs to be as long as it needs to be.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Villeneuve’s take on the sci-fi classic starring Timothée Chalamet, Oscar Isaac and Zendaya has been given room to breathe, creating a colossal spectacle\nIf there can ever be a moment of triumph for a director, when the anxiety of influence is vanquished – for a bit, anyway – then Denis Villeneuve might have achieved it. This eerily vast and awe-inspiring epic, a cathedral of interplanetary strangeness, is better than the attempt a generation ago by an acknowledged master.\nDavid Lynch’s Dune from 1984 was an interesting, rackety, flawed movie that attempted to cram the entirety of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel into its running time – the result was like Flash Gordon without the laughs. Villeneuve, with his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, has used less than half the book (with a second episode to come) and allowed it room to grow: to breathe and drift through unimaginably vast reaches of fictional galaxies, with images of architecturally enormous spacecraft moving into view, or delicately lowering themselves on to alien landscapes of parched and austere beauty, particularly the ravishingly pure desert landmass of “Dune”, the contested planet itself. Star Wars’ debt to Dune, and now Dune’s debt to Star Wars, has been extensively discussed (amusingly, Dune gives us moving holograms rather like the one in which Princess Leia first begged Obi-Wan Kenobi for help). But this blockpulverising film feels more like TE Lawrence’s imperious version of The Phantom Menace. This is how it ought to have been.\n Continue reading...",

With the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) humiliated by a defeat of unprecedented magnitude, Olaf Scholz of the Social Democratic party (SPD) is the clear favourite to succeed Angela Merkel at the chancellery.\nThe real question is the balance of power between the SPD’s two coalition partners, the Greens and the Free Democratic party (FDP). A key issue in those negotiations is who gets the job at the Finance Ministry. The politicians concerned may be unknown outside of Germany, and the battle over who controls the purse strings may not seem glamorous.

By the time she met Inspector Anthony Lumb, she had suffered years of online abuse – including death threats, letters sent to her house and relentless trolling.\nHer problems began in November 2011, when she sent an innocuous message of support to an X Factor contestant on Facebook.

          "description": "Starring Sarah Paulson and Beanie Feldstein, Ryan Murphy’s 10-part series on the infamous White House affair is propulsive, addictive and shot through with comedy\nThere is nothing stranger than the recent past. For that reason, it can be a goldmine for writers, and none has extracted more from it in the past few years than Ryan Murphy. The late 90s is his most fertile seam, furnishing all three parts of his American Crime Story anthology. The opening season gave him his first – and unexpected – post-Glee hit in the glorious The People v OJ Simpson, which retold the story of the 1994 killing of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman and the most infamous murder trial of modern (media) times that followed. Then came The Assassination of Gianni Versace, about the death of the designer at the hands of Andrew Cunanan in 1997. Now we have Impeachment (BBC Two), which focuses on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal that occupied minds, headlines and the House of Representatives for much of 1998.\nThis new 10-part instalment, written mainly by Sarah Burgess, puts the bureaucrat Linda Tripp – played by the most revered of his repertory company, Sarah Paulson – rather than the US president or his intern front and centre. The drama opens in 1998 with her leading the FBI to Monica (Beanie Feldstein) and leading her away to a hotel for questioning (“It’s for your own good,” Tripp assures her) as part of the Paula Jones investigation and pending lawsuit. We then move back to 1993, the suicide of Vince Foster and the Whitewater investigation, presented as the beginning of Tripp’s move from loyal (if abrasive and self-aggrandising) White House civil servant to embittered employee ready to put a metaphorical bomb under the place.\n Continue reading...",

With 12 minutes to go on a wild, fun and unexpectedly open night, Mohamed Salah stood on the penalty spot, handed the chance to deliver victory for Liverpool. Two-up inside 13 minutes, it was now 2-2, and nothing was certain any more. Except of course the Egyptian who stepped up and coolly slotted in what would prove the winner.\nNot that a Liverpool win seemed certain even then, Atlético Madrid almost immediately having a late penalty of their own removed by the VAR, Luis Suárez left lamenting that he would not get the opportunity Salah had. And, even then it was not yet over. When at last it was, there was exhaustion. There was exhilaration too, plus recrimination and an awful lot to pick over. “When these two teams face each other some drama is guaranteed,” Klopp said afterwards, only the word “some” felt seriously inadequate.\n Continue reading...",

So they set up a themed WhatsApp group over lockdown instead as a way to keep connected. “We called it Gore Girls,” says Lloyd Malcolm, writer of the Olivier award-winning play Emilia. “It was a way of talking about horror, sharing memes, watching films on Zoom.

As the host of the upcoming Cop26 summit, and the first major industrialised country to put a net zero target into law, the UK is in a unique position. By significantly upping their ambitions with regard to emissions cuts, ministers had the chance to send a powerful message.

          "description": "Parties which have united to fight next spring’s election have chosen a leader  who may win over swing voters\nFor over a decade, Viktor Orbán has steadily eroded democratic norms in Hungary, creating clientelistic networks of power and influence that bend the country to his will. The electoral system has been adjusted to the advantage of Fidesz, the party Mr Orbán leads. A pro-government media empire has been carefully constructed, while independent outlets have been targeted by smear campaigns and starved of cash. Critical voices in education and the arts have been harassed and intimidated.\nDuring Hungary’s progress towards a kind of soft autocracy, opposition political parties on the left and right have been on a steep learning curve. In parliamentary elections in 2018 they were divided, and duly fell – delivering Mr Orbán a handsome majority. But a year later, in local polls, they joined forces and won notable victories, including the mayoralty in Budapest. This “united front” strategy, comprising six parties from across the political spectrum, now faces its greatest test as Mr Orbán seeks to win a fourth term in the spring.\n Continue reading...",

I slide through the doorway to the makeup room, carving a two-lane highway into the dusty floors. The lighted mirrors paint the room in yellow and gold. I wriggle my tiny body into one of the cubby holes for bags and belongings. The doorknob turns. The door creeps open. “Found me”, I yell at Tiwi. After a three-second delay he yells back “but where”, still searching behind the velvet curtains on stage.\nDad’s boxing gym is hidden below that stage. The heavy bags, the leather pads, the medicine balls, and the sparring gloves wash the stage in the smell of rubber and sweat. Tiwi and I tutu (fidget) with the flood lighting most weeks, waiting for the boxers to finish their cardio session on stage and head for sparring and pad work downstairs. Dad screams at that perfect decibel level where the soundwaves crash against your ear but the background violence scrambles the electrical signal to your brain. Is he saying “right, left, right” or “left, right, left”? For most of Kawerau in the 1990s the town hall was a boxing gym with cosmetic facilities. For Tiwi and I, it was our playground.\n Continue reading...",

By its own calculations, this is the first time the government has produced a package of measures that will help achieve its interim five yearly carbon targets leading up to net zero by the middle of the century.\nThe scale of transformation that the strategy is set to unleash across the entire UK economy is breathtaking. Our electricity is expected to be fully clean by 2035. Our homes will no longer have new gas boilers fitted after then either. No new polluting car will roam our roads from 2030 and we will plant trees in an area the size of Milton Keynes every year from 2025, and all of this at a cost that is less than what we spend on defence each year.

          "description": "We explain the rule change voted through, what could happen next and why the clubs are so worried\n• Exclusive: Clubs vote to block Newcastle sponsorship deals\nIt was the follow-up to a special meeting that 19 of the clubs had last Tuesday, which was to discuss their concerns about the Saudi-led £305m takeover of Newcastle and its implications for them. Newcastle were excluded from that meeting, which was extraordinary in itself. How often do 19 clubs convene to talk strategically about just one? The other clubs have worried about the potential for Newcastle’s uber-rich owners to strike commercial deals with companies in Saudi Arabia that could give them an advantage. And so, as the Guardian revealed, the clubs proposed the draft of a rule change that would temporarily ban what are called related party transactions – in other words, arrangements with businesses with which club owners are associated. Monday’s meeting, which mainly involved participants dialling in via conferencing software, was to review and vote on the amendment.\n Continue reading...",

A conference room at the Science Museum where he could indulge his fantasy as the Bertie Booster of British politics by giving his standard upbeat, cut out and keep after dinner speech – never mind that it was actually shortly after breakfast – to an invited audience of some of the world’s richest men and women at a Global Investment Summit.\nThis was Boris at his most optimistic. No need to mention the inconvenient truths of food and lorry driver shortages. Covid infection rates increasing at an alarming rate could also be safely ignored. Those were all just present day irritants. The story he wanted to tell was of a future in which Britain would lead the world to the promised land of net zero by 2050. A speech that was light on detail but peppered with recycled gags. Not that Boris got many laughs. Perhaps billionaires don’t have the same sense of humour as the rest of us. Or maybe they’d heard them all before at Davos.\n Continue reading...",

It is a mistake to only see it as an act of terrorism and simply address questions of physical safety. This tragedy is not disconnected from the steady acidic drip that daily erodes democracy through insult, hate mail and threats, lying, deliberately misleading journalism, lack of accountability and abuse of power. We can take personal responsibility for the health of our democratic culture by better understanding what strengthens and protects it. Cynicism and political apathy won’t help that cause.\nThe tributes paid to Sir David all indicate that as an MP, and as a man of integrity, he embodied the values that we can revere and encourage in our public servants and in ourselves.

Keir Starmer is in a much deeper hole, 15 October). But there is no point in gaining power if you sell your soul to the devil. The BBC’s Blair & Brown: The New Labour Revolution, which he refers to, also attributes Labour’s success to vanquishing or at least suppressing the left of the party, thus bringing Labour into the electable mainstream.\nThis comfortable analysis forgets that no political party in this country has won an election in the past 30 years without the backing of News International. It is this and not the showmanship of Boris Johnson that explains why, despite all the U-turns and bungling of the Covid response, the Conservatives remain ahead in the polls.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Nintendo Switch; Mercury Steam/Nintendo\nSamus Aran’s return after 20 years is welcome – but other games have taken up her mantle in the meantime\nThe recipe for a Metroid game is clear and concise: there’s a labyrinthine system of rooms and corridors, an oppressive science-fiction environment, an escalating series of power-ups. A good-feeling gun. A great-feeling jump. A limited map you unlock gradually and rewardingly. Metroid Dread is proficient at all of this: it feels good to play, for a while. But I found that it got tiresome. There is little to hold the player in the world beyond the feeling of a perfectly executed attack or dodge. In the 20 years since we last saw bounty hunter Samus Aran run around in one of these 2D space stations, there have been several indie games modelled on the Metroid format – such as Iconoclasts, and Hollow Knight – that offer far more atmosphere, depth and life than Dread’s slickly predictable tunnels.\nMetroid Dread is a game about trying not to die alone in a cave system full of hostile fauna and predatory machines that are invested in hunting you down. This is pretty much all the storytelling you’re handed, outside of some panels of text and short and awkwardly placed cut-scenes at the start of the game that establish us in Samus Aran’s timeline. She will encounter old enemies, and some new ones; this planet has no allies for the player. She begins her quest all but totally disempowered, her suit deconstructed, and we lead her towards the surface, regaining her abilities along the way. This game does not offer much of a guiding hand, and the challenge is tough.\nMetroid Dread is out now; £49.99\n Continue reading...",

No amount of planetary jeopardy is going to change that\nBoris Johnson’s recruitment to the global crusade against carbon emissions is, by his own admission, recent. On a visit to New York last month, the prime minister confessed to a back catalogue of newspaper columns that “weren’t entirely supportive of the current struggle”.

It was a fact that human activity was heating the planet when Johnson cavilled, and it is still a fact now.\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist\n Continue reading...",

You never see anyone buying it, and recipes always specify flat-leaf. \nColin, Stonehaven\n“Curly parsley is not seen as glamorous, like Italian or French flat-leaf parsley, but as the garnish of the 1960s,” says Jane Scotter, who runs the revered biodynamic farm Fern Verrow in Herefordshire. “It’s just gone out of fashion, but it is by far the better tasting of the two.” And she’s in good company, with Fergus Henderson, chef and founder of St John in London, also firmly on #teamcurly. “It has substance. When chopped, it retains a bounce, a fluff, whereas flat-leaf parsley chops down to sharp shards that take over a dish in a swishing sort of way.” Fighting talk, indeed.\n Continue reading...",

If you include periods spent living in France and Italy, my time living in Wales shrinks further still. Like many of my friends and classmates, I left when I was 18, and it would be a lie if I said that I wasn’t desperate to go. I wanted a “big life”, and felt that I needed to be in a big city to achieve that. Despite this, I still feel Welsh; identity can be a knotty thing. If you pressed me I suppose I would say that I’m “London Welsh”, part of the diaspora that has made the English capital our home.\nI’ve been thinking about this as the Welsh government launches a drive to keep young Welsh people in their homeland. Thanks in part to a “brain drain” – always a slightly unpleasant term, I find, implying as it does that the people who choose to stay are lacking them – the proportion of working-age adults is dropping, which, coupled with an ageing population that tends to be poorer and sicklier than England’s, is causing alarm. It has effects on the language, too – the Welsh government hopes to have achieved a million Welsh speakers by 2050.\nRhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Having changed their name to distance themselves from nationalistic fans, the indie rockers’ empathic, elemental new album shows they’re still wild at heart\nWith their propensity for foliage-covered stages and a large bear mascot that wanders through the audience at their gigs, Sea Power are used to people getting the wrong end of the stick. “The word ‘oddball’ has been put around, and that can put people off,” guitarist Martin Noble ruefully admits. But, 20 years on from their debut single, the band’s recent decision to change their name from British Sea Power marks a new beginning at a time of creative revival. The wacky bear is retiring and the band are fizzing with a new sense of purpose, fresh from finishing their new album Everything Was Forever, winning a Bafta for their soundtrack to the video game Disco Elysium, and performing their first gigs in two years. Noble has missed playing live so much that he compares going onstage to “coming up on an E”.\nTheir new name has been enthusiastically chanted by fans, and the sole complaint they’ve had came from “some fellas who had to make their own Sea Power T-shirts because we’d not brought merch out quick enough”, says Yan Scott Wilkinson, the band’s co-frontman, with brother Neil Wilkinson. In the end, the only truly negative reaction to dropping “British” came from social media and the rightwing press. The name British Sea Power “had become a monkey on our backs”, in the words of Noble, and the band had become uncomfortable that some people were wrongly interpreting it as nationalistic, even antagonistic – although to do that they would have had to ignore the band’s history of writing songs such as Waving Flags, a pro-immigration anthem.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "When Randy Sue first saw a picture of Courtney on a friend’s wall, she jokingly called him her future husband. They finally met three years later, married and now live in Houston, Texas\nRandy Sue was studying at college in Texas in the spring of 1966 when she went to visit a friend in Raymondville, near the Mexican border. “I spotted a picture of a handsome man on the wall and asked who it was. My friend told me it was her brother, Courtney, who was in Germany with the army,” she says. Randy Sue joked to her friend’s mother that she was going to be her daughter-in-law. “She hugged me and said she’d been praying for me,” she laughs.\nBut when Courtney received a letter from his sister telling him she had met “his future wife”, he was less than impressed. “I was 5,000 miles away and definitely didn’t want my sister telling me what to do,” he says. In 1968, he returned to Texas and found a job at a company that made office equipment. His sister continued her matchmaking attempts. “She kept telling each of us that the other one really wanted to meet up,” says Randy Sue. “But I’d just seen it as a joke.”\nWant to share your story?

          "description": "In a country of centralised power, he did all he could to make himself a man of Southend rather than simply Westminster\nBritish politics rightly commemorates its own. David Amess, killed in his home constituency last week, was eulogised on Monday in the Commons and St Margaret’s church, Westminster, as what the prime minister called “one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics”. He was not a star of the parliamentary firmament, but rather that paragon: a “good constituency MP”. The solemn minute’s silence held in the House of Commons and the tributes to Amess from MPs testified to a profession under collective threat. It is one that lies at the heart of representational democracy: that of intermediary between the rulers and the ruled.\nAmess’s death comes at what many see as a critical juncture in democracy’s theatre of public debate. MPs are exposed to criticism and attack as never before, thanks in large part to the glaringly inadequate regulation of social media. Male and female MPs, particularly female ones, are being subjected to appalling anonymous trolling. An Amnesty survey in the run-up to the 2017 general election found the MP Diane Abbott was in receipt of an average of 51 abusive tweets a day. Her colleague Jess Phillips has to keep in constant touch with the police.

          "description": "I am not empowered or optimised by my current morning routine. I am a bleary-eyed doom-scroller. So I spent a month ditching my phone, exercising, journalling and embracing the dawn, to find out what really works\nAre morning people better than night owls? I was delighted to discover that they are not. The “morning morality effect” – the notion that our capacity to resist lying and cheating dwindles through the day – applies only to larks, research shows; nighthawks behave better in the evenings.\nMorning people do, however, have a reputation for getting stuff done. Early rising is associated with energy, optimisation and efficiency; it is a foundational principle of all manner of self-help and self-actualisation programmes. “If you look at many of the most productive people in the world, they’ll have one thing in common: they were early risers,” says one wide-eyed zealot in the trailer for the motivational guru Hal Elrod’s film about his “miracle morning”, as Oprah Winfrey, Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Einstein flash past. Elrod’s Savers routine – silence, affirmations, visualisation, exercise, reading, scribing – is a classic of the genre, but he is only one of many urging us to seize the day super-early.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Archaeological discoveries are shattering scholars’ long-held beliefs about how the earliest humans organised their societies – and hint at possibilities for our own\nIn some ways, accounts of “human origins” play a similar role for us today as myth did for ancient Greeks or Polynesians. This is not to cast aspersions on the scientific rigour or value of these accounts. It is simply to observe that the two fulfil somewhat similar functions. If we think on a scale of, say, the last 3m years, there actually was a time when someone, after all, did have to light a fire, cook a meal or perform a marriage ceremony for the first time. We know these things happened. Still, we really don’t know how. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to make up stories about what might have happened: stories which necessarily reflect our own fears, desires, obsessions and concerns. As a result, such distant times can become a vast canvas for the working out of our collective fantasies.\nLet’s take just one example. Back in the 1980s, there was a great deal of buzz about a “mitochondrial Eve”, the putative common ancestor of our entire species. Granted, no one was claiming to have actually found the physical remains of such an ancestor, but DNA sequencing demonstrated that such an Eve must have existed, perhaps as recently as 120,000 years ago. And while no one imagined we’d ever find Eve herself, the discovery of a variety of other fossil skulls rescued from the Great Rift Valley in east Africa seemed to provide a suggestion as to what Eve might have looked like and where she might have lived. While scientists continued debating the ins and outs, popular magazines were soon carrying stories about a modern counterpart to the Garden of Eden, the original incubator of humanity, the savanna-womb that gave life to us all.\n Continue reading...",

Britain’s economic recovery from Covid-19 was fading, inflationary pressures stalking the country would prove temporary and the Bank of England fiddling with interest rates would hardly produce more lorry drivers or make the wind blow for turbines.\nFast forward and the Bank’s governor appears to have changed his tune.

“We’ve got a democracy in this country; we should treasure and value that, not undermine it by having different chambers according to people's racial background.”]]></summary>

“This is about celebrating the people of New South Wales because any person who chooses to visit here wants to experience what we experience,” he said.  

“And it also is a lovely reminder for us not to take this wonderful state for granted. 

“It’s an opportunity for people to travel around their own state, travel in their own city and say to people right across Australia that the door is open, we’ve got a big smile on our face and we want to welcome you to come and feel NSW the same way that we experience it.” 

Mr Ayres said the campaign is a “gamechanger” for the state’s tourism industry and will ensure businesses know they are “completely supported” by the NSW government during the pandemic recovery.]]></summary>

“This is the first time we’ve launched a campaign like this in over a decade but it is one that comes off the back of many challenges that our state has faced, from drought, to bushfires, to this pandemic,” he said. 

“But there is a bright future for our state and I think this campaign will really take our state to the next level. 

“We want to make sure that as we open up, we open up well and that as Australia's truly only global city and state that we continue to drive the visitor economy here in NSW. 

“We want our people to stay, we want the rest of Australia to visit and we want the world to come and feel and experience the best that NSW has to offer.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The survival of the Morrison government is at stake amid the Coalition's negotiations over a net zero climate deal, according to The Australian’s Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly.

It comes as the Nationals are expected to inform the Prime Minister of their decision on net zero on Sunday.

Mr Kelly remarked that the "broad contours" of the deal – to have net zero by 2050 with no greater increase to the emissions reduction target by 2030 –  is an "agonising political compromise".

"There are two issues here," Mr Kelly told Sky News Australia.

"At stake is the survival of the Morrison government – whether it can make this policy transition.

"And related to this is whether the Coalition parties can change policy on climate change or they are destroying themselves internally as they've done so many times in the past."]]></summary>

It’s no secret that on the work front, the Covid narrative has predominantly been a negative one, with two-thirds of Australian businesses reporting a hit to revenue in 2020 and underemployment hitting a historic high of 13.8%, impacting 1.8 million people.
Despite this, lockdowns have brought growth to certain sectors, with Australians spending big in areas such as beauty, hobbies and home furnishings. This increased desire for little luxuries is sometimes called the lipstick index. So what does it feel like to be an outlier in a downturn? We asked four business owners to share their experiences.

Scavengers, trophy hunters and “metal pirates” are looting the treasures under the seas – and there are fears Australia’s first submarine could be next.
The location of HMAS AE1’s wreck is a secret closely held by a small group of people, including relatives of the 35 men who were on board when the Royal Australian Navy vessel sank at the outbreak of the first world war.

Mark was a member of an online witches and vampire community and liked to wear a bit of blingy jewellery. He really liked his friend Joe’s cooking. Gordon always had a can of Jim Beam in his hand and a flaring temper but, until he was evicted for anger management-related issues, he kept his public housing flat spotless. Marianne loved it when the volunteers did her hands and nails.
Jon Owen talks to them sometimes, Mark, Gordon and Marianne, sitting as they do in their urns on a purple-fabric-swathed table in the store room just off his office. “I often find myself chatting to them,” says the pastor of the Wayside Chapel in Sydney’s Potts Point. If the day’s particularly bad, Mark, Gordon and Marianne remind Owen that we all only live for, like, five minutes and, whatever it is that’s troubling him, he should just “let it go”.

In the small town of Nundle, a story of rural change is playing out. The picturesque little New England town of 289 people, nestled in the Great Dividing Range, has traditionally relied on farming and increasingly tourism to keep it ticking over.
The Hills of Gold Wind Farm has reversed the usual expected lines of division. A section of those born and working in the district are generally in favour of the green energy project and the income it may bring, while tree changers or retirees are opposed.

The Super League breakaway. The resignation of Ed Woodward. The Old Trafford protests. The Europa League final. The signings of Jadon Sancho and Raphaël Varane. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s new contract. The return of Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo’s two-goal debut against Newcastle. The injury-time defeat to Young Boys. The injury-time victory over Villarreal. Losing 4-2 to Leicester. And most recently coming back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 against Atalanta, a result so eminently predictable it almost counts as plagiarism.
That’s just the past six months. Six months of wins, losses, triumph, heartbreak, scandal, rumour, greed and excess at the world’s most meme-able football club. It’s tempting to see the modern Manchester United as essentially a directionless vehicle, a model of flailing incompetence that provides plenty of entertainment but whose wider purpose is unclear. But what if this is the wider purpose? What if we’re not watching the painstaking construction of a long and glorious project, but its realisation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the final whistle blew, the majority of Brighton’s supporters stood and applauded their side, which to some extent was a curious sight given they had just lost 4-1. But this was a hammering in which the losing team deserved praise having shown character and quality in the second half, dominating possession and territory and securing the goal their efforts deserved. Yet as the home fans cheered so did those in the away end having not just seen a win by Manchester City but another statement of intent.
Four days after dismantling Club Brugge in the Champions League, City were at it again, this time getting the job done in the first half, scoring three times, through Ilkay Gündogan and Phil Foden, twice, during a devastating 18-minute spell. Their approach play was typically quick, slick and accurate and, having secured a fourth goal via Riyad Mahrez’s stoppage-time strike, they climb to second. City will drop back a place should Liverpool beat Manchester United on Sunday but what the champions made abundantly clear here is that when it comes to this season’s title race, they are not going away.

Adil Rashid takes 4-2 to set up win with 70 balls to spare

A few too many wickets fell for them to be completely cock-a-hoop, but England’s introduction to the T20 World Cup fell not far short of perfection as they skittled the defending champions for 55 before securing victory with 70 balls and six wickets to spare. “It’s as good as it gets, to start a tournament like that,” Eoin Morgan said.

People are pretending that dogs they acquired during lockdown are strays so that rescue centres take them in, after failing to sell them online, animal rescue charities and shelters have warned.
Figures from March revealed that more than 3.2m pets were bought by UK households during lockdown. Since Covid restrictions were lifted and people have started to return to the office, charities have reported a growing trend of people abandoning their pandemic pets as they no longer have as much time for them.

Next month the Bank of England might begin the long road back to higher interest rates. Plenty of financial traders believe comments and speeches by the governor Andrew Bailey and some of his colleagues make it a likely possibility.
If it doesn’t happen in November, the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet again in December to survey the economy. It could be then that the nine-strong group takes on the Grinch’s mantle, stealing Christmas cheer with a hike in the nation’s cost of borrowing.

There is a fitting Sopranos-esque vagueness to the phrase “in talks with”, as in, Tony is in talks with New York or Carmela is in talks with the priest. The US streaming platform HBO Max has announced that it is in talks with David Chase about bringing the surprising TV hit of the pandemic back to the small screen. “We’re talking to David about a new series, Sopranos-related, on HBO Max,” confirmed television executive Ann Sarnoff last week.
It would be surprising, at this stage of renewed Sopranos fever, if these talks were not happening. The last two years have brought flash-in-the-pan TV smashes, from Mare of Easttown to Bridgerton to Squid Game, but there has been nothing like the level of reverence still bestowed on The Sopranos, either by those rewatching it for the second or third time (I put my hand up here) or the people who have come to it fresh, having been too young to absorb it when it was first on air.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forgoing a particular style or era as influence, a fashion designer has created a cosy and colourful home in Paris
When Célia Bernard and her husband Jean-Marie Castille found this two-bedroom Parisian apartment directly on the Right Bank of the Seine, they were sure about one thing: they didn’t want to paint it white. Instead, they opted for a khaki in the entry hall and dark chocolate brown doors. They also painted the living room in a deep yellow that she refers to as “curry”.
Colour is very much at the heart of the ebullient Bernard’s latest professional venture. After 22 years working as a broker in finance, she set up a fashion brand, Love and Let Dye, with her friend, Marine Vignes, who is best known in France as a TV weather presenter. The idea came to them during a trip to Bali in 2020, where they decided to have some clothes made for themselves. “We hired a scooter and went down little alleyways hunting for a tailor and for women who worked with the tie-and-dye technique,” recalls Bernard. “For me, it’s like Proust’s madeleine. Tie-and-dye takes me back to my youth when I sold jeans on Venice Beach in Los Angeles.”

If you wanted a paragon of astute, thoroughly modern whistleblowing, then Frances Haugen is your woman. She is the former Facebook employee who revealed that the company knew about the harm that some of its products, especially Instagram, were causing but did little or nothing about them because it prioritised growth and revenue above all else.
A good CV is essential to establish your street cred and Haugen ticks all the Silicon Valley boxes. A degree in electrical engineering? Check. An MBA from Harvard? Check. Specialised in algorithmic management? Check. Experience with, and knowledge of, ranking algorithms at a number of tech companies? Check (Google, Pinterest, Yelp). And of course you’ll have held down a substantial position in the company about which you are blowing the whistle. Again, Haugen ticks that box: at Facebook, she was the lead product manager on the civic misinformation team, which dealt with issues of democracy and misinformation; she later worked on counterespionage.

Households are being warned of a “Christmas crisis” in bin collections as drivers quit their jobs for better pay working for supermarkets and food hauliers.
Bin lorry drivers are being offered pay deals worth as much as £40,000 a year to switch to jobs in the food industry. One council in Lancashire said last week it had lost almost half of its drivers in the last three months.

The Reuse-a-Shoe scheme allowed UK customers to deposit their old trainers at a Nike store, where they would be shipped to one of Nike’s four distribution centres in Flanders, Belgium, to be recycled into rubber for use in track surfaces, gym flooring and new Nike footwear and apparel.

Around seven years ago, Garrett, was in a local Pizza Hut with his friends, having a day so ordinary that it is cumbersome to describe. He was 16 – or thereabouts – and had been told by teachers to go around nearby businesses and ask for gift vouchers that the school could use as prizes in a raffle. There were five other teenagers with Garrett, and they’d just finished speaking to the restaurant manager when suddenly, out of nowhere, Garrett’s his body was flooded with shock. He felt cold and clammy and had an “overwhelming sense that something had happened”. He desperately tried to stop himself crying in front of his peers.
“It was like I’d just been told something terrible,” the now 23-year-old from the southwest of England says (his name has been changed on his request). “I couldn’t tell you exactly what it was, but I just knew something had happened.” Garrett returned home and tried to distract himself from a feeling he describes as grief. The phone rang. His mum answered it. A few hours earlier – around the time Garrett was in the restaurant – his grandfather had died from a sudden heart attack while on a cruise.

Not long after she took over as BBC political correspondent, Laura Kuenssberg suggested that what she was most excited about “was to allow the voices of people outside this weirdo Palace of Westminster to be heard. I thought the whole social media thing might be really positive.”
Six years on, as Kuennssberg appears to have come to the end of her tenure, she might have been careful what she wished for. The voices outside Westminster she has mostly been hearing are those toxic tones that have become the white noise of our fractured public life.

The emerald-green five-year-old hawthorn hedge glistens in autumnal sunshine. In the cider apple orchard and grass pastures below, younger hedges shoot off towards a fast-flowing trout stream.
History has come full circle in Blackmore Farm, which nestles in the foothills of the Quantocks in Somerset. The owner, Ian Dyer, remembers helping his father, who arrived as a tenant farmer in the 1950s, grub out old hedges in the 1960s and 1970s. But – like increasing numbers of landowners – he has hired a hedgelayer to bring back his hedges to provide habitats for wildlife, capture carbon and slow water pouring off fields into rivers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A stellar cast enliven the director’s uneven three-story anthology featuring a student protest, an insane artist and a heist thriller
The films of Wes Anderson, with their intricately layered details and fanatically meticulous design, almost invariably reward a second viewing. That is certainly the case with his latest, The French Dispatch, a showily starry portmanteau picture that takes as a jumping-off point the final issue of a supplement magazine for the fictional Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun newspaper. But given that on a first viewing I found it to be among the most punchable films I have ever seen, the initial bar was lower than with some of Anderson’s other pictures.
The problem with the anthology structure – the film is made of three discrete stories, each based on a feature article by one of the magazine’s star writers, plus a brief scene-setting travelogue that digs into the insalubrious corners of the town of Ennui-sur-Blasé – is that it’s almost inevitably uneven. And however engaging the film’s final story is – the most satisfying by no small margin; a food review turned heist thriller narrated by and starring Jeffrey Wright at his most mellifluous and charming – patience will be sorely tried by the segment that comes before it.

The kingdom, one of the world's biggest polluters, said it would also join a global effort to cut methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030.
The UN says more than 130 countries have set or are considering a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, an objective it says is "imperative" to safeguard a liveable climate.]]></summary>

No, I can’t believe it either. No self-respecting, red-blooded man should be spending time with his tiny babies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The comic actor and writer on his new sitcom about community service, sharing Christopher Walken’s omelette and portraying a serial killer
Stephen Merchant, 46, is a writer, producer, director and comic actor who rose to fame in 2001 with The Office, about life at a paper supply company in Slough. Created by Merchant and his former XFM co-presenter Ricky Gervais, the awards-festooned series spawned a US version starring Steve Carell, and is credited with prompting a new wave of comedy series that dispensed with laughter tracks and punchlines in favour of a mockumentary style. The pair followed up The Office with Extras, in which Merchant played incompetent agent to Gervais’s struggling actor, amid a feast of celebrity cameos. In 2013 he wrote and starred in the HBO sitcom Hello Ladies, a series based on his standup routine and which followed an Englishman in Los Angeles and his failed attempts at dating. Elsewhere, he has worked variously as a DJ on BBC 6 Music, a podcaster and voiceover artist, and has appeared in films including Hot Fuzz and Jojo Rabbit.
Merchant’s new six-part series, The Outlaws, co-created with Elgin James, follows the fortunes of seven strangers doing community service in Merchant’s former hometown of Bristol. Characters include Darren Boyd’s reactionary businessman, Clare Perkins’ diehard activist, Eleanor Tomlinson’s spoilt influencer, Merchant’s sad-sack solicitor – and Christopher Walken in his first role in a British comedy, as a career criminal fresh out of prison.

“Don’t worry, you’re just a dot on a screen like in Pac-Man,” says Bilal, a Tesco shop assistant, when a customer expresses concern about the hundreds of cameras tracking them as they browse in the new “checkout-free” store in central London.
From the outside this Tesco Express on High Holborn looks identical to thousands of others across the country. But inside there are no tills and no self-checkout machines. Instead you scan a QR code on your phone to gain entry, and a complex system of cameras and weighted shelves figure out what you have picked up. Once you’re done you just walk out and your phone (eventually) buzzes to tell you how much you’ve spent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Increasingly, authoritarians are likening ‘genderism’ to ‘communism’ and ‘totalitarianism’
In June, the Hungarian parliament voted overwhelmingly to eliminate from public schools all teaching related to “homosexuality and gender change”, associating LGBTQI rights and education with pedophilia and totalitarian cultural politics. In late May, Danish MPs passed a resolution against “excessive activism” in academic research environments, including gender studies, race theory, postcolonial and immigration studies in their list of culprits. In December 2020, the supreme court in Romania struck down a law that would have forbidden the teaching of “gender identity theory” but the debate there rages on. Trans-free spaces in Poland have been declared by transphobes eager to purify Poland of corrosive cultural influences from the US and the UK. Turkey’s withdrawal from the Istanbul convention in March sent shudders through the EU, since one of its main objections was the inclusion of protections for women and children against violence, and this “problem” was linked to the foreign word, “gender”.
The attacks on so-called “gender ideology” have grown in recent years throughout the world, dominating public debate stoked by electronic networks and backed by extensive rightwing Catholic and evangelical organizations. Although not always in accord, these groups concur that the traditional family is under attack, that children in the classroom are being indoctrinated to become homosexuals, and that “gender” is a dangerous, if not diabolical, ideology threatening to destroy families, local cultures, civilization, and even “man” himself.

Hundreds of thousands of families are to receive extra support as part of a £500m package from the government that will include the creation of a network of “family hubs” across England, but concerns have been raised that the measures do not go far enough.
The government describes the centres, which will launch in 75 local authorities, as “one-stop shops” for advice and guidance. They are similar in some respects to the Sure Start centres introduced under Tony Blair, although ministers believe they will provide a more comprehensive service.

For the past 16 years, I have spent my days nosing round other people’s homes like a design-obsessed basset hound. I have been granted access through hundreds of locked doors, perched on wobbly Windsor chairs, and taken tea in stylish studio flats, cleverly converted factories and even a working barge. 
Throughout all this, I’ve learned a lot. As The Modern House has grown, I’ve discovered that these homes – from studio flats to listed architectural masterpieces – have the same design principles in common: clever layouts, masterly manipulation of natural light, tactile materials, a connection to nature, sheer exuberance and personality in decoration – and much more.

When 21-year-old Aaron Arter feels blue, he sings along to the King. When he is happy, he sings along to the King. When he’s getting ready for bed, or walking down the street, or doing odd jobs as a gardener, or entertaining the elderly residents of local care homes, he sings along to the King.
There are Elvis pillows in his bedroom, an Elvis fob on his keychain. He wears a chunky brass signet ring with the initials TCB on it. (TCB stands for Taking Care of Business, Elvis’s personal motto.) He has a wardrobe full of Elvis clothes: silk shirts with exaggerated collars and leather jackets and crisp high-waisted trousers. There is a photo of Elvis on his mirror, which he kisses for luck. He dreams of owning a pink Cadillac. If you cut him open, you’d probably find a map ofGraceland, the singer’s former mansion, tattooed on his heart.

One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, so goes the saying. That is certainly evident through the rise of exchanges on platforms such as Olio, Facebook Marketplace and Nextdoor, where people happily take their neighbours’ unwanted goods off their hands. Sometimes items are new or as good as new; sometimes they are a piece of furniture to upcycle and breathe new life into. 
From saving money to helping the planet, many people turn to volunteer-run online communities focused on goods that would otherwise go to landfill, rather than head to Ikea. Searches for the term “Freecycle” have increased 22% from July 2018 to July 2021, while the number of people Googling “where can I find free stuff?” shot up 800% over the same period, according to the data provider SEMrush. Some scour skips, the streets, and ask around in their community for free stuff – all ways of consuming without spending a penny.

In 2001, the record business was in freefall due to digital piracy, and the best way out of this accelerating crisis came in the shape of a white device the size of a deck of cards. The iPod, launched 20 years ago this week, was also how Apple’s Steve Jobs was able to prey on a failing business in order to avenge his own past failures – exiled between 1985 and 1997 from the company he co-founded – by turning Apple into the most profitable company in history.
Before the iPod lifeline arrived in October 2001, record labels were in full panic mode. In its annual report for 2001, record company trade body IFPI called it “a turbulent” year, blaming filesharing and CD burning for a revenue slump. Jay Berman was chief exective of IFPI at the time and calls the scale of filesharing then “a crisis of momentous proportions” for record labels. “It really was,” he says, “a foreign invasion.”

Ten years ago Dublin was nicknamed Silicon Valley’s “home from home” with tech superstars including Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk queueing up to snap up office space, avail themselves of local Irish hospitality and low tax.
But while the decision of Google, Facebook, Yahoo, LinkedIn, eBay, Amazon and more recently TikTok to locate their European headquarters in the Irish capital helped cement its reputation as one of the region’s leading tech hubs, questions are now being asked about whether they will stay.
Earlier this month Ireland signed up to landmark reforms for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, up from the current level of 12.5% set by Dublin, in the biggest shifts for the…]]></summary>

The trip Hossein Fatemi made to Somalia in 2011, on assignment for an Iranian organisation, marked a turning point in his career. The New York-based photojournalist had covered many serious situations, but what he saw in Mogadishu – “thousands of children dying in desert hospitals, without food or water, without anything” – is something, he says, that he will never forget.

They were vitamin pills, but that didn’t seem to matter to the police officer in Cleveland, who mentioned that his orders had come from the Nixon White House. It was 1970. I had just started a campus speaking tour protesting against the Vietnam war, and was under surveillance by the National Security Agency. I raised my fist for the mugshot, and after a night in jail, they let me go.
I think the idea was to discredit my opposition to the war, and maybe get my speeches cancelled. Instead, students turned up in their thousands. My first arrest wasn’t for an act of civil disobedience, exactly, but the lesson I took away from that surreal experience was just how powerful it can be to set your ideals against the machinery of the state.

When Joe Biden huddled with a group of historians in March, the conversation revolved around thinking big like one of his predecessors, Franklin Roosevelt, architect of the New Deal. Biden, it seemed, wanted to join him in the first rank of transformational US presidents.
Six months later, a very different gathering took place this week outside the White House gates.

Achieving a global climate deal in Glasgow in the next three weeks will be harder than signing the Paris agreement of 2015, the UK president-designate of the Cop26 talks has said.
Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister in charge of the UK-hosted talks, just over a week away, said the task would be to get nearly 200 countries to implement stringent cuts to their greenhouse gas emissions, in line with holding global temperature increases to within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels – a goal fast receding as global carbon output continues to climb.

There should be no surprise about leaked documents showing governments lobbying hard against clauses in an upcoming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that they regard as detrimental to their interests. Ever since the start of the UN process aimed at preventing unchecked global heating (known as Cop, short for Conference of the Parties), countries have sought to protect their own industries, economies and people – particularly the fossil fuel businesses that have powered capitalist development since the Industrial Revolution.
Last time the nations met, in Madrid in 2019, progress was scuppered by a wall of resistance with President Trump perched on top. The hope was that with Trump gone, and a US administration in place that recognises the need for action, such blockages could be overcome. This remains the aim in the run-up to the conference opening in Glasgow next weekend. Given the warnings from scientists, who are unequivocal about the dangers, there is no rational alternative than to persist with the attempt at global climate governance that the Cop represents. As the British Treasury acknowledged in a review published this week, the cost of inaction will be higher than the cost of action.

Cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup gets into full swing on Saturday when Australia play South Africa in Abu Dhabi and England face reigning champions West Indies in Dubai. But if you are only joining now, because England and the other supposed “big guns” are playing, you have missed a week of extraordinary action, with eight less prestigious cricketing countries fighting for places in the so-called “Super 12s” stage of the tournament. 
The eight who contested the preliminary stages were a motley bunch: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Ireland, all of which are Test-playing countries of relatively recent vintage; Scotland, which aspires to Test status and won a famous victory against England in a 50-over match in 2018; the Netherlands, where cricket has been played for two centuries and which beat England at Lord’s in the 2009 World Cup; and three true minnows – Oman, Namibia and Papua New Guinea. Namibia’s win over the Netherlands on Wednesday was in its own way as big a shock as that unexpected victory by the Dutch over England in 2009. They have deservedly qualified for the cup’s last stage.

I agree with George Monbiot that “catastrophe is not a matter of fate. It’s a matter of choice” (Think big on climate: the transformation of society in months has been done before, 20 October). I don’t think, though, that the analogy with the US in 1941 holds, for two reasons. 
First, the US was responding to a national threat, post-Pearl Harbor. The climate emergency is a planet-wide threat, at a time when universalism and international solidarity are in retreat. Second, as Franklin D Roosevelt stated, the US achieved a “miracle of production” – the mobilisation of a capitalist economy on a war footing. But the process of production was inherent to the logic of capitalism.

My favourite documentary of the past decade – by some margin – is OJ: Made in America, Ezra Edelman’s epic account of the rise and fall of OJ Simpson. Those who haven’t seen it (and you really, really should see it – the whole thing is available on the iPlayer right now) will primarily remember it as the longest ever “film”, at nearly eight hours, to win an Academy Award.

Made in America is clearly a TV series, and a really great example of what you can do with that format. It is sprawling and comprehensive, bouncing between styles – at one minute a sport documentary, the next a forensic true crime series, then a rumination on racial politics in late 20th-century America – and using its initially narrow focus as a means of exploring a whole host of other topics: race, fame, misogyny, police brutality, the media, professional sport, even the flow of information itself.

A high-concept, ultraviolent South Korean thriller that was rejected by Seoul TV executives for a decade might seem like an unlikely candidate for the most popular series ever to be shown on Netflix. But by now you probably know that Squid Game – in which hundreds of down-on-their-luck contestants play a series of children’s games for a vast cash prize in the knowledge that if they lose they will be killed on the spot – has defied that analysis and become a worldwide phenomenon, a lightning rod for debates over depictions of violence, and an instant classic costume option for Halloween.
Underneath all that hype, though, is a story that resonates deeply in South Korea – where levels of personal debt are now equivalent to 105% of GDP – and has struck a chord around the world. In Rachel Humphreys’ final episode as presenter, the Seoul-based culture journalist Nemo Kim explains the connection between the TV show and a crisis founded on a system that makes taking out a loan as easy as buying a cup of coffee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Industrial Relations Minister Tony Burke says corruption occurs where a member of parliament is receiving a benefit on the side and so it is therefore necessary for the public to know the source of Christian Porter's legal funds.
 
It comes as Mr Porter will not be investigated over his use of anonymous donations to fund a defamation action against the ABC.

The former attorney-general avoided a referral to parliament’s powerful privileges committee after the Morrison government cast a stunning vote.

Speaker Tony Smith recommended Mr Porter be referred to the committee for investigation.

"There are obligations we have as members of parliament – and that's what this whole process that's existed for 120 years, that the Morrison-Joyce government blew up yesterday, is about," Mr Burke told Sky News Australia.

"It's there to make sure members of parliament don't get bribed or if they do get bribed – to make sure that the public finds out about it."

Mr Burke denied that Labor's calls to refer Mr Porter to the parliamentary privileges committee were part of a "witch-hunt" against the former attorney-general.

"This is a fundamental principle of whether or not we have a measure to prevent corruption in Australian politics. 

"Corruption occurs where a member of parliament is receiving a benefit on the side – here Christian Porter did receive a benefit on the side – a sizeable amount of cash.

"Therefore, to work out whether or not corruption was involved, to work out whether or not he's acted improperly – we need to know the source of those funds."]]></summary>

Contain your excitement over Facebook’s possible renaming of itself for the coming age of “the metaverse”, and consider Wednesday’s other story about the social media group. Facebook’s quarrel with the UK competition watchdog offered a near-perfect illustration of corporate arrogance and entitlement in action.
The case is extraordinary for the fact that the stakes were so low: Facebook’s $400m (£290m) purchase last year of Giphy, a software firm that specialises in Gifs, the essential visual aid for social media meme-peddlers, can barely have registered on Mark Zuckerberg’s radar. The purchase price equated to less than 0.5% of Facebook’s global revenues.

Ireland will face a winner-takes-all showdown against Namibia on Friday after a resounding 70-run defeat to Sri Lanka, who became the first side to qualify from the T20 World Cup first round stage.
Sri Lanka were on the ropes after lurching to eight for three inside the first 10 balls in Abu Dhabi and were grateful for a decisive 123-run stand between Pathum Nissanka and Wanindu Hasaranga to subdue Ireland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The puppet’s journey from Turkey to the UK charmed audiences – but also discomfited them. And that’s the point
This week, a 3.5-metre tall puppet called Little Amal landed at Folkestone. From there she is travelling to London, Coventry and finally Manchester. Since July she has taken an 8,000km journey through Turkey, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France, following the route that a child migrant from Syria might. Her journey provides “an opportunity for people to be sympathetic and imagine what it would be like to be her”, David Lan, one of the project’s organisers, has said.
As a piece of theatre Little Amal is an extraordinary thing: incredibly simple, almost naive in conception, and yet utterly epic in execution. Hers (somehow it is impossible to say “its”) has been a tremendous, and deeply touching, journey – an intervention in the long and difficult debate about refugees that powerfully foregrounds simple human empathy rather than policy points or dry arguments. Along the way she has been greeted joyfully by crowds, sent letters by Belgian school pupils, blessed by the pope and, on Sunday, will celebrate her birthday at the V&A in London with local children and a great deal of cake. But there has been a darker side, too: she has also been pelted with stones, protested against, and denied access to a village of Greek monasteries. Little Amal, as a work of art, has been welcomed by audiences, and delighted them. She has also discomfited them, even repulsed them. In other words, as Lan has pointed out, her presence has allowed a kind of re-enactment of the attitudes displayed to real refugees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The government must take a more cautious and focused approach to a pandemic that is not over
Post-lockdown Britain is sailing dangerously close to the wind. Wednesday’s tally of 49,139 cases is far higher than equivalent figures being recorded elsewhere in Europe. Hospitalisations and deaths are on the rise, and one in five intensive care beds is currently occupied by a Covid patient. The NHS – struggling to deal with a waiting list of 6 million people – has warned that if the escalation in cases is not checked, invidious decisions will have to be taken about priorities. Exhausted staff, too few in number, say they are on the cusp of being overwhelmed. And winter has yet to begin.
Given that darkening context, Sajid Javid’s first Covid press conference did very little to reassure. Mr Javid’s announcement that two new anti-viral drugs, which reduce the severity of Covid infections, may be available in months, was very good news. But as the NHS Confederation calls for urgent measures to prevent an imminent crisis, it was also a distraction. On the issue of the day, the health secretary flatly rejected the idea that the pressures on the NHS were becoming unsustainable, despite admitting that Covid cases could rise as high as 100,000 a day. He offered instead a pep talk to the public, urging it to remember to act cautiously when mixing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a certain flair to director Adam Randall’s Collateral-with-blood-sucking caper but not enough to disguise a reheated script
There’s a frustrating dissonance to the pre-Halloween Netflix horror Night Teeth, slick packaging belying rotten innards. While the director, Adam Randall, finds inventive ways to break out of the drab Netflix visual template we’ve all grown weary of, any flair he shows is dampened by a script that struggles to add anything to an undead subgenre that’s already been done to death. It’s all bark, no bite.
In first-time writer Brent Dillon’s graphic novel-adjacent universe, there is the age-old trope of the age-old truce between vampires and humans, rules that are agreed upon to maintain a certain equilibrium. In the Boyle Heights neighbourhood of Los Angeles, vampires aren’t allowed in without permission but as the film opens, a rebel mission is launched by Victor (Alfie Allen), tired of kowtowing to the human cattle. He starts a war against Jay (Raul Castillo), a mortal who upholds the law and hunts those who step out of line. Jay’s younger half-brother Benny (Love Simon’s Jorge Lendeborg Jr) finds himself caught in the middle when he takes over Jay’s chauffeur shift and is forced by two vampiric passengers (Lucy Fry and Debby Ryan), working with Victor, to drive them through the city as they destroy various vampire heads before the sun comes up.

The collection of new climate policies released by the government this week are being scrutinised for their ambition and effectiveness. But it is also crucial to judge them for their fairness. We need to reduce total emissions as rapidly as possible – “fairness” at a macro level means protecting poorer countries that have done little to cause the problem, and those countries that have emitted the most overall, such as the UK, moving fastest. 
At a more micro level, fairness is also vital. The move to net zero will lead to major changes across all aspects of UK society, and a lot of less well-off people are understandably worrying whether they can afford to cut their emissions. It’s essential to design policies so that this transition is fair for individuals and that no one is left behind. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also makes sense politically: if fairness is not baked in then people will resist change, and that reasonable resentment will be magnified and manipulated by those seeking to delay action for other reasons.

Russia has hosted the most high-profile international talks on Afghanistan since the Taliban took power, calling for an injection of aid to help the crippled economy but also demanding a more inclusive government.
Senior Russian diplomats made clear that formal recognition of the Taliban regime was not on the table until it does more to improve human rights and broadens an all-male cabinet, most of them clerics from the Pashtun ethnic group.

Ages ago, an old friend who was an early adopter of environmental concerns wanted a new kitchen. He asked an expert he knew from his work in woodland conservation what wood his new kitchen should be built with. He was startled to get a sharp response: “If you really care, then don’t come to me asking which wood to use; ask yourself if you really need a new kitchen.” Point taken, but not much acted upon, by him, me or anyone else I’ve come across.
I’m so sick of stuff. Some of it is stuff I really need or that is at least genuinely nice to have, but a good 70% is useless stuff. Clothes I’ll never wear, books I’ll never read, kitchen utensils I’ll never utilise. Items big and small that presumably felt essential the day I bought them but turned out to be quite the opposite. I suppose that as I get older the 70% figure will grow and grow until the morning of the day I shuffle off this mortal coil. At this point the percentage of stuff I own that is useless to me will stand at a nice round 100, because, of course, I won’t be able to take it with me. But what I will be able to do is leave it to my children to bump up the percentage of stuff useless to them that they own. And so it goes on.

Publication of the government’s blueprint to hit net zero by 2050 has opened up a rift between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over spending.
The chancellor is concerned on many levels about the prime minister’s tendency to believe that “everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds”, a phrase Voltaire used in his novel Candide to lampoon the optimists of mid-18th-century France. According to Treasury insiders, Johnson is far too sanguine about Britain’s ability to emerge from the pandemic and tackle the climate emergency without meticulous planning and careful management of the public finances.

John Harris’s excellent article (The gap between reckless Brexit promises and reality will soon be too big to ignore, 18 October) was extremely sobering. “What happens,” he asks, “when some watershed is reached, and the fact that people were conned becomes inescapable?”, linking the way public trust was undermined by the Iraq war and by Brexit. Both before war was declared on Iraq, and also before Brexit was enacted, some 1 million people marched through the streets of London in opposition. These people were engaged, informed, enlightened folk from across the country, committed enough to march for policies that to them represented the right way forward, for Britain and the world. The governments of the day ignored them.
The consequences of the Iraq war and Brexit are now all too clear. We should not have made war; we should not have left Europe. As John Harris says: “People in the political mainstream – by which I chiefly mean Labour MPs – need to start loudly talking about Brexit … and what life outside Europe is doing to us.” Absolutely. I feel sure there are millions of voters desperate for Keir Starmer, the shadow cabinet and all Labour MPs, at every opportunity, to do exactly that.

The decision by opposition parties in Hungary to mount a united campaign against the governing party, Fidesz (Editorial, 19 October) has a message for Labour. Here, as there, the opposition fails spectacularly if it campaigns as separate parties. The last time the UK Conservative party won more votes than the combination of the other parties was in 1959. A substantial minority of voters always votes Conservative, but it has never been more than a minority. Long periods of uninterrupted Conservative rule are not necessary to rein in leftwing absurdities; instead, absurdities of the right become entrenched.
The UK government has moved further to the right than any previous Conservative administration and is doing long-term damage (5 million children growing up in poverty, for example). Because the opposition parties will not unite, the Conservatives are almost certain to win again. As in Hungary, they are reshaping the electoral system to bolster their chances. Who knows what damage yet more rightwing governments will do?

When the official inquiry into the Covid-19 crisis finally happens, the current phase of the pandemic will warrant as much scrutiny as any of the earlier ones. It’s surely the strangest and in some ways the most disturbing period of the pandemic so far, not least because there seems to be collective denial from the government and much of the public that we are still in a pandemic at all.
Some statistics might help to correct any such fantasies. Since mid-August, as many people in the UK have been dying from Covid every two weeks as typically die directly from flu in a year: that’s 1,400 or so. The UK has one of the highest per capita infection rates in the world: four times higher than Germany, nine times higher than France, and 25 times higher than Spain. Britain is a total outlier in western Europe.

A police chief has admitted a decision by a misconduct panel to grant lifelong anonymity to a male officer who harassed a female domestic abuse victim opened the service up to accusations of a lack of transparency.
The specially trained domestic officer bombarded the young woman with messages as he pursued an “improper emotional relationship” with her after being assigned to work on her case, the panel heard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this column we ask funny people for the best online ephemera to brighten our day. Concetta Caristo starts by casting her mind back to high school
My earliest memory of something funny online was the Papa’s Boat meme. It’s a reference to a poem called The Old World that was featured on the 2010 School Certificate English test for Year 10 students. In 2010, Facebook was king and so was liking funny Facebook pages. They would come up in your newsfeed as “Concetta Caristo likes Standing naked on the porch waiting for google maps to take a picture” or “Concetta Caristo likes Carrying a fork in your pocket just in case someone has lasagna”.
The night after the first English exam, I’m awake scrolling my Facebook newsfeed when I start to see some of my classmates liking these pages about the poem I had JUST spent all morning reading and analysing. “Sarah likes That awkward moment when Papa keeps his boat.” I’m dying. “Bryony likes I throw my Papa in the air sometimes saying ayo, where’d my boat go?” My mind is exploding and I’m laughing alone in my bed as meme page after meme page rolls in. In that moment I was at one with every single Year 10 student in New South Wales. Do any other 1994 babies remember this? If you do reach out to me for God’s sake.

I learned to surf in California, and continued to develop after moving to Hawaii. By the time I left, moving back to Sydney during Covid, I could still pull off a sweet wave, even where the big boys surfed. At least on a good day. Surfing makes me feel powerful, connected and happy.
Starting life again in Australia – a place so familiar, yet so foreign – was really hard. I found myself a boyfriend who gave me a sweet longboard for my birthday, but then we broke up. I was a mess: lonely, lost, stressed and sad. I tried to enrol friends who surfed to come out with me, but everyone was too busy with their robust lives of children and work. I tried to make friends on the beach, but surfers can be surprisingly solemn. I tried going alone and I found it too intimidating.

A blueprint to change public behaviour to cut carbon emissions, including levies on high-carbon food and a reduction in frequent flying, was published by the government alongside its net zero strategy on Tuesday but was withdrawn within a few hours.
Recommendations in the blueprint are in contrast to Boris Johnson’s promise in the strategy foreword that transitioning to net zero could happen without sacrificing the things we love. “This strategy shows how we can build back greener, without so much as a hair shirt in sight,” the foreword stated.

Bruce reveals toll job has taken and indicates he will retire 

Paulo Fonseca is in advanced talks with Newcastle after emerging as the leading contender to replace Steve Bruce, who departed St James’ Park by “mutual consent” on Wednesday morning.
Fonseca, a 48-year-old Portuguese previously in charge of Shakhtar Donetsk and Roma, is out of work and keen on working for Newcastle’s new Saudi Arabian-led owners.

Jair Bolsonaro should be charged with crimes against humanity and jailed for his “macabre” reaction to a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 600,000 Brazilians, including a disproportionate number of indigenous citizens, a congressional inquiry has found.

I took this on the first day of the protests in Foley Square, New York, following the murder of George Floyd. I’ve witnessed protests before but nothing like this. It was intense, volatile and angry. People were sick and tired – and ready to fight for their rights.
The video of his killing came at a specific moment. People were already angry after the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.

The International Olympic Committee, Fifa, World Rugby and other sport governing bodies are facing new calls for a radical overhaul of their concussion policies from a group of academics, researchers, clinicians and carers, who argue that the process has consistently underplayed the risks of concussive and sub-concussive impacts.
The criticism is focussed on the work of the Concussion In Sport Group (CISG), whose work is funded by the IOC, Fifa, World Rugby, the FEI (the International Federation for Equestrian Sports), the FIA and the International Ice Hockey Federation, and shapes concussion policy across elite and grassroots sport.

Andy Harris is a former chief information officer at Utility Point

I take no pleasure in saying to Ofgem, “I told you so.” Thanks to a perfect storm in the energy sector, many suppliers have been failing. But with all storms, you can see the clouds building first. Utility Point, the business I helped set up and build to one with more than 220,000 customers, was a victim of the regulators’ inaction.

Relatives of the victims who sat in the courtroom and watched the hearing via Zoom shook their heads or broke down in tears as Cruz entered his pleas and later apologized for his crimes.

It all started when Steffan Rees, a karate instructor in south Wales, had a lightbulb moment. He realised that lots of children were unable to come to his classes because the kit was too expensive, while at the same time others had stuff sitting unused in their wardrobes. He suggested to People and Work – the charity for which he was working – that it introduced a sportswear and equipment recycling scheme, which also removed some of the financial barriers to sport. The momentum built, it won national lottery funding, and Natasha Burnell started running Play It Again Sport in November 2019.
Burnell loves her job, which involves lots of human interaction and plenty of rummaging around in her huge store room. Play It Again Sport is based in the Rhonda Valley, an ex-mining community with high levels of obesity, sickness and unemployment and lower levels of access to transport.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oscar-winning composer and lyricist known for his hugely successful songs for Willy Wonka and Doctor Dolittle
The songwriter Leslie Bricusse, who has died aged 90, was a quiet man with an unshakeable sense of his own worth, an outlook justly cultivated in the early 1960s when his two stage musicals with Anthony Newley, Stop the World – I Want to Get Off (1961) and The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd (1964), spawned songs that became standards recorded by Sammy Davis Jr (What Kind of Fool Am I?), Nina Simone (Feeling Good) and Tony Bennett (Who Can I Turn To?), as well as Newley himself.
Pop ballads and romantic torch songs were his speciality in a vast output including music and/or lyrics for more than 40 films and plays; he won his first Oscar for Talk to the Animals, sung, sort of, by Rex Harrison in the 1967 movie Doctor Dolittle, which he adapted from Hugh Lofting’s novels, and his second for his score for Blake Edwards’s Victor Victoria (1982) starring Julie Andrews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The acclaimed Irish writer on writing short works, the Magdalene Laundries and her new hobby, horse training
For those who know and follow her work, a new Claire Keegan book is as rare and precious as a diamond in a coalmine. There have been just four of them over 22 years, and all are small, sharp and brilliant. Fortunately for an author so sparing with her output, those who know and follow her include an international array of literary connoisseurs, and many of the children passing through the Irish school system.
Eleven years have passed since her third published work – a standalone story, Foster – cemented her place as one of Ireland’s canonical writers, with a place on the leaving certificate syllabus. Foster is a gentle yarn about a small girl who is thrown upon the kindness of strangers while her mother gives birth to yet another baby. Her latest, Small Things Like These, is altogether darker and more ominous. It’s also longer, though pagination isn’t what separates the two. “To me,” says Keegan, “Foster isn’t a novel. It’s a long short story. And this is a novel, efficiently told. Unfortunately, this is often mistaken for what is condensed, and I have no time at all for what is condensed. I think something needs to be as long as it needs to be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Villeneuve’s take on the sci-fi classic starring Timothée Chalamet, Oscar Isaac and Zendaya has been given room to breathe, creating a colossal spectacle
If there can ever be a moment of triumph for a director, when the anxiety of influence is vanquished – for a bit, anyway – then Denis Villeneuve might have achieved it. This eerily vast and awe-inspiring epic, a cathedral of interplanetary strangeness, is better than the attempt a generation ago by an acknowledged master.
David Lynch’s Dune from 1984 was an interesting, rackety, flawed movie that attempted to cram the entirety of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel into its running time – the result was like Flash Gordon without the laughs. Villeneuve, with his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, has used less than half the book (with a second episode to come) and allowed it room to grow: to breathe and drift through unimaginably vast reaches of fictional galaxies, with images of architecturally enormous spacecraft moving into view, or delicately lowering themselves on to alien landscapes of parched and austere beauty, particularly the ravishingly pure desert landmass of “Dune”, the contested planet itself. Star Wars’ debt to Dune, and now Dune’s debt to Star Wars, has been extensively discussed (amusingly, Dune gives us moving holograms rather like the one in which Princess Leia first begged Obi-Wan Kenobi for help). But this blockpulverising film feels more like TE Lawrence’s imperious version of The Phantom Menace. This is how it ought to have been.

But at the same time, he also has to unveil this new unstoppable machine of death without scaring off too many regular Facebook users. How will he be able to manage such an impossible highwire act?

When Rishi Sunak stands in front of the Commons for the spending review next week, the chancellor will no doubt serve up “build back better” buzzwords and promises of “levelling up”. Meanwhile you can expect him to be silent about the biggest funding crisis facing this country – and with it, the families going without crucial local services.

But local councils help form the fabric of day-to-day life: the library in your neighbourhood, the special needs teaching assistant in the local primary school, the carer who drops by to help your nan.

I am a 22-year-old woman and a virgin. I’m in a relationship and we have had oral sex, but we have tried and failed to have intercourse. It seems I’m really scared of sex. I like the idea of it, I want to feel the pleasure, but it seems as if my body won’t allow it to happen. I have tried to do it multiple times, but sober or drunk I haven’t been able to let someone penetrate me.  
I am really confused and embarrassed at not being able to perform with my partner. We have been dating for a whole year now and I feel bad that he hasn’t had the chance to feel pleasured during this whole time. We have had our good times during oral sex, which has satisfied both of us, but still there is the lack of penetrative sex. My partner, being the sweetest person, doesn’t seem to have a problem waiting for me to be comfortable, but it’s been too long and I am doubting myself. I don’t know if there is some problem with me.

Adam Tooze is the author of Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World’s Economy

The result of the German election was known within minutes of the polls closing on 26 September. But the kind of government that will emerge is being decided now, behind closed doors, in intense three-way coalition negotiations. With the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) humiliated by a defeat of unprecedented magnitude, Olaf Scholz of the Social Democratic party (SPD) is the clear favourite to succeed Angela Merkel at the chancellery.
The real question is the balance of power between the SPD’s two coalition partners, the Greens and the Free Democratic party (FDP). A key issue in those negotiations is who gets the job at the Finance Ministry. The politicians concerned may be unknown outside of Germany, and the battle over who controls the purse strings may not seem glamorous. But it will, in fact, decide the prospects not just of Germany’s next government, but of Europe.
Adam Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University. His latest book is Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World’s Economy

Until recently, rye bread fell into the category of foods I loved but preferred to leave to the experts (see also croissants, yoghurt and proper chips). I’d written recipes in the past, but, in an effort to make them as quick and easy as possible, I’d sacrificed some of the dense darkness that had attracted me to rye in the first place. This updated version is lengthy, but stupidly simple – and much, much better.

The impact of extreme heat on the human body is not unlike what happens when a car overheats. Failure starts in one or two systems, and eventually it takes over the whole engine until the car stops.
That’s according to Mike McGeehin, environmental health epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “When the body can no longer cool itself it immediately impacts the circulatory system. The heart, the kidneys, and the body become more and more heated and eventually our cognitive abilities begin to desert us – and that’s when people begin fainting, eventually going into a coma and dying.”

But bear with me: I think this really matters regarding how we understand our culture – and the balance of power in a media business where data is king.

Mr Horatio Parmouk, our beloved cat, turned up at my house as a stray and never left.

Everyone loved him; he had his own Facebook page, wore various outfits in return for a cat biscuit or six and even starred in an advert for a hat company.

Nicola Brookes was at the lowest point of her life when she turned to the police for help. By the time she met Inspector Anthony Lumb, she had suffered years of online abuse – including death threats, letters sent to her house and relentless trolling.
Her problems began in November 2011, when she sent an innocuous message of support to an X Factor contestant on Facebook. The contestant was being trolled online and Brookes wrote: “Keep your friends and your family close. They’ll move on to someone else soon.” Within hours, she had received hundreds of abusive messages. Brookes was stunned – she was called an “insane old crone”, a “demented witch”.

Firel Joseph was driving through Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, one evening this year when he noticed a white Toyota Land Cruiser with official license plates trailing close to his rear bumper. Assuming the other driver wanted to overtake him, the 44-year-old development worker gave way. Then things took a hellish turn.
The car skidded to a halt in front of Joseph, while another vehicle appeared behind, boxing him in. Six men, wearing flak jackets and armed with rifles, piled out of the Land Cruiser, moving with military discipline.

Credit Suisse has been fined nearly £350m by global regulators, pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and agreed to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars worth of debt owed by Mozambique in an attempt to draw a line under the long-running “tuna bonds” loan scandal.
The Swiss banking company had been accused of “serious” failings in its financial crime controls by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice that will put the bank under heavy monitoring for three years after having “defrauded US and international investors”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starring Sarah Paulson and Beanie Feldstein, Ryan Murphy’s 10-part series on the infamous White House affair is propulsive, addictive and shot through with comedy
There is nothing stranger than the recent past. For that reason, it can be a goldmine for writers, and none has extracted more from it in the past few years than Ryan Murphy. The late 90s is his most fertile seam, furnishing all three parts of his American Crime Story anthology. The opening season gave him his first – and unexpected – post-Glee hit in the glorious The People v OJ Simpson, which retold the story of the 1994 killing of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman and the most infamous murder trial of modern (media) times that followed. Then came The Assassination of Gianni Versace, about the death of the designer at the hands of Andrew Cunanan in 1997. Now we have Impeachment (BBC Two), which focuses on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal that occupied minds, headlines and the House of Representatives for much of 1998.
This new 10-part instalment, written mainly by Sarah Burgess, puts the bureaucrat Linda Tripp – played by the most revered of his repertory company, Sarah Paulson – rather than the US president or his intern front and centre. The drama opens in 1998 with her leading the FBI to Monica (Beanie Feldstein) and leading her away to a hotel for questioning (“It’s for your own good,” Tripp assures her) as part of the Paula Jones investigation and pending lawsuit. We then move back to 1993, the suicide of Vince Foster and the Whitewater investigation, presented as the beginning of Tripp’s move from loyal (if abrasive and self-aggrandising) White House civil servant to embittered employee ready to put a metaphorical bomb under the place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jürgen Klopp had said that it wasn’t likely that Liverpool would score three at the Wanda Metropolitano, but in the end that is exactly what they had to do. With 12 minutes to go on a wild, fun and unexpectedly open night, Mohamed Salah stood on the penalty spot, handed the chance to deliver victory for Liverpool. Two-up inside 13 minutes, it was now 2-2, and nothing was certain any more. Except of course the Egyptian who stepped up and coolly slotted in what would prove the winner.
Not that a Liverpool win seemed certain even then, Atlético Madrid almost immediately having a late penalty of their own removed by the VAR, Luis Suárez left lamenting that he would not get the opportunity Salah had. And, even then it was not yet over. When at last it was, there was exhaustion. There was exhilaration too, plus recrimination and an awful lot to pick over. “When these two teams face each other some drama is guaranteed,” Klopp said afterwards, only the word “some” felt seriously inadequate.

Andy Murray came through an epic first-round battle with Frances Tiafoe at the European Open, winning 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (7-9), 7-6 (10-8) in Antwerp after almost four hours.
The former world No 1 showed great stamina to deny his 23-year-old opponent at the end of three tie-breaks and set up a second-round meeting with Diego Schwartzman. “It is the longest three-set match I have ever played by quite a distance,” Murray said afterwards. “It was an unbelievable battle.”

Still, nobody at a festive Parc des Princes seemed to mind too much. After looking wooden and curiously passive for an hour, Paris came to life in the last 25 minutes, beating an impressive Leipzig side despite having little cohesion and not much in the way of a tactical plan, but two of the most irresistible attackers on the planet.
With three defeats out of three, Leipzig are now virtually eliminated, and for all their spirit and running, the spotlight will now fall on their new coach Jesse Marsch.

Police said a 20-year-old man was arrested after one woman reported “a scratching sensation” and suspected her drink had been spiked at a club in Nottingham city centre on Saturday. He was later released on bail.

• Read the story below
Lucy Caldwell has won the BBC national short story award for her “masterful” All the People Were Mean and Bad, in which the mother of a young child takes a transatlantic flight after the death of a relative.
Exploring parenthood, marriage, kindness and the glimpse of an alternative life, the story was praised by judges for its “masterful storytelling”, “deep truthfulness” and “deft precision”. It draws its title from the Noah’s Ark picture book that Caldwell’s protagonist is reading to her 21-month-old daughter as she flies back to London from Toronto after her cousin’s funeral.

Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, Abi Zakarian and Sampira are self-professed horror fiends. All three grew up addicted to ghost stories and gorefests, but as playwrights they have found it frustrating to see the form so often dismissed by theatre-makers as lowbrow or better suited to the medium of film.
They sought to address this last year with a one-day programme of horror at the now defunct Bunker theatre in London, but the pandemic stymied its staging. So they set up a themed WhatsApp group over lockdown instead as a way to keep connected. “We called it Gore Girls,” says Lloyd Malcolm, writer of the Olivier award-winning play Emilia. “It was a way of talking about horror, sharing memes, watching films on Zoom. It became a real support group.”

If you want to live in an energy inefficient home, expect to pay more for your mortgage. Or perhaps the implied message in the government’s net zero documents was starker: you won’t even get a mortgage unless you bring the property up to scratch.
As nudges to homeowners and homebuyers go, it’s strong stuff. Quite right too, one might say: UK homes, on average, are shockingly leaky. And, since most home improvements happen soon after a purchase, one can see the logic in linking an energy upgrade to the mortgage process.

As Covid-19 infections surge in England, people are increasingly reporting catching Sars-CoV-2 for a second or even third time. 
New analysis has suggested that unvaccinated individuals should expect to be reinfected with Covid-19 every 16 months, on average.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The plan to decarbonise Britain must be welcomed. But in key areas it falls short 
In a number of ways the net zero strategy published by the UK government on Tuesday falls short of what was hoped for, and perhaps even expected by more optimistic observers. The public investment that ministers have committed to is insufficient, their faith in private-sector solutions overblown.
The combination is concerning. As the host of the upcoming Cop26 summit, and the first major industrialised country to put a net zero target into law, the UK is in a unique position. By significantly upping their ambitions with regard to emissions cuts, ministers had the chance to send a powerful message. Instead, they have hedged many of the new commitments in ways which risk undermining them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parties which have united to fight next spring’s election have chosen a leader  who may win over swing voters
For over a decade, Viktor Orbán has steadily eroded democratic norms in Hungary, creating clientelistic networks of power and influence that bend the country to his will. The electoral system has been adjusted to the advantage of Fidesz, the party Mr Orbán leads. A pro-government media empire has been carefully constructed, while independent outlets have been targeted by smear campaigns and starved of cash. Critical voices in education and the arts have been harassed and intimidated.
During Hungary’s progress towards a kind of soft autocracy, opposition political parties on the left and right have been on a steep learning curve. In parliamentary elections in 2018 they were divided, and duly fell – delivering Mr Orbán a handsome majority. But a year later, in local polls, they joined forces and won notable victories, including the mayoralty in Budapest. This “united front” strategy, comprising six parties from across the political spectrum, now faces its greatest test as Mr Orbán seeks to win a fourth term in the spring.

Survivors of the 2015 terrorist attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris have described their fear and panic when they were held hostage in a corridor for more than two hours by two gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs and wearing explosive vests.
Three witnesses – one a 23-year-old barman at the time of the attack and two IT workers who were in their 30s – told France’s biggest ever criminal trial how they were among 11 people first forced to watch as the gunmen took pleasure in targeting and shooting concertgoers from a balcony, and then taken to a narrow upstairs corridor and used as human shields.

One of my earliest memories is racing up a flight of hollow stairs in Kawerau’s town hall as Tiwi, my first friend, counts down from 20. “Ready or not, here I come” he roars from the stage. I slide through the doorway to the makeup room, carving a two-lane highway into the dusty floors. The lighted mirrors paint the room in yellow and gold. I wriggle my tiny body into one of the cubby holes for bags and belongings. The doorknob turns. The door creeps open. “Found me”, I yell at Tiwi. After a three-second delay he yells back “but where”, still searching behind the velvet curtains on stage.
Dad’s boxing gym is hidden below that stage. The heavy bags, the leather pads, the medicine balls, and the sparring gloves wash the stage in the smell of rubber and sweat. Tiwi and I tutu (fidget) with the flood lighting most weeks, waiting for the boxers to finish their cardio session on stage and head for sparring and pad work downstairs. Dad screams at that perfect decibel level where the soundwaves crash against your ear but the background violence scrambles the electrical signal to your brain. Is he saying “right, left, right” or “left, right, left”? For most of Kawerau in the 1990s the town hall was a boxing gym with cosmetic facilities. For Tiwi and I, it was our playground.

Eddie Jones’s best-laid plans have already been disrupted following the news that two of his likely starters will miss England’s entire autumn series. Luke Cowan-Dickie and Anthony Watson have both been ruled out of all their country’s November Tests, forcing Jones to recall Jamie George just 24 hours after the Saracens hooker was pointedly omitted.
The ankle injury that forced Cowan-Dickie off the field during Exeter’s win at Wasps on Saturday will prevent the Cornishman from featuring against Tonga, Australia and South Africa, with a scan suggesting his absence could be a lengthy one. The luckless Watson is also likely to miss the Six Nations after Bath confirmed he had ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in the latter stages of his club’s 71-17 home defeat against Saracens. Harlequins’ Joe Marchant has been called up to replace him.

Analysis: UK’s net zero strategy has a glaring omission: Rishi Sunak

The UK government’s long-awaited strategy for reaching net zero emissions falls short on ambition and is not backed up with adequate funding, experts and campaigners have warned.
Ministers on Tuesday revealed a plan that they said would create up to 440,000 jobs and “unlock” £90bn in investment in the next decade, most of it from private sector companies.

Downing Street has confirmed that Covid vaccine appointments for children will be bookable from next week in England, as Boris Johnson said the UK still faced a “difficult winter” as a result of coronavirus and flu putting pressure on the NHS.
After the latest daily number of deaths climbed to 223 – the highest level since early March – the prime minister’s spokesperson echoed concerns from the NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, that people needed to be reminded the virus was still circulating in order to drive up vaccination rates.

Two weeks before the most important climate conference in history, the UK government has finally published its long-awaited net zero strategy, alongside a bevy of other policy documents upwards of 2,000 pages. By its own calculations, this is the first time the government has produced a package of measures that will help achieve its interim five yearly carbon targets leading up to net zero by the middle of the century.
The scale of transformation that the strategy is set to unleash across the entire UK economy is breathtaking. Our electricity is expected to be fully clean by 2035. Our homes will no longer have new gas boilers fitted after then either. No new polluting car will roam our roads from 2030 and we will plant trees in an area the size of Milton Keynes every year from 2025, and all of this at a cost that is less than what we spend on defence each year. Across industry, finance, farming, waste and every other imaginable sector, carbon reduction is set to be the new mantra.

Michael Gove has been targeted by anti-lockdown protesters who shouted obscenities at him as he walked alone in Westminster towards his office in an incident branded “abhorrent” by Downing Street.
He was the latest figure to be harassed by hordes of people protesting Covid restrictions – most of which have been lifted – after England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the journalists Nick Watt and Jeremy Vine were also targeted.

• Exclusive: Clubs vote to block Newcastle sponsorship deals
It was the follow-up to a special meeting that 19 of the clubs had last Tuesday, which was to discuss their concerns about the Saudi-led £305m takeover of Newcastle and its implications for them. Newcastle were excluded from that meeting, which was extraordinary in itself. How often do 19 clubs convene to talk strategically about just one? The other clubs have worried about the potential for Newcastle’s uber-rich owners to strike commercial deals with companies in Saudi Arabia that could give them an advantage. And so, as the Guardian revealed, the clubs proposed the draft of a rule change that would temporarily ban what are called related party transactions – in other words, arrangements with businesses with which club owners are associated. Monday’s meeting, which mainly involved participants dialling in via conferencing software, was to review and vote on the amendment.

Sit back and enjoy the ride. Here was Boris Johnson in his comfort zone. A conference room at the Science Museum where he could indulge his fantasy as the Bertie Booster of British politics by giving his standard upbeat, cut out and keep after dinner speech – never mind that it was actually shortly after breakfast – to an invited audience of some of the world’s richest men and women at a Global Investment Summit.
This was Boris at his most optimistic. No need to mention the inconvenient truths of food and lorry driver shortages. Covid infection rates increasing at an alarming rate could also be safely ignored. Those were all just present day irritants. The story he wanted to tell was of a future in which Britain would lead the world to the promised land of net zero by 2050. A speech that was light on detail but peppered with recycled gags. Not that Boris got many laughs. Perhaps billionaires don’t have the same sense of humour as the rest of us. Or maybe they’d heard them all before at Davos.

A retired accountant who stabbed her husband to death has told a jury that he repeatedly beat her and once held a knife to her throat, as footage was released of her being arrested and telling police she hoped he would die – and asking officers to fetch her coat.
Penelope Jackson, 66, said her husband, former army Lt Col David Jackson, 78, once head-butted her when he returned from home and threw her down cellar stairs during a Mother’s Day celebration at an officer’s mess.

The senseless killing of Sir David Amess (‘Laughter, service, compassion’: MPs remember Sir David Amess, 18 October) was a violent attack on democracy. It is a mistake to only see it as an act of terrorism and simply address questions of physical safety. This tragedy is not disconnected from the steady acidic drip that daily erodes democracy through insult, hate mail and threats, lying, deliberately misleading journalism, lack of accountability and abuse of power. We can take personal responsibility for the health of our democratic culture by better understanding what strengthens and protects it. Cynicism and political apathy won’t help that cause.
The tributes paid to Sir David all indicate that as an MP, and as a man of integrity, he embodied the values that we can revere and encourage in our public servants and in ourselves. They are the qualities which enhance liberal democracy.

Jonathan Freedland attributes New Labour’s electoral victory in 1997 to “doing whatever it took to win” (Tony Blair had it easy. Keir Starmer is in a much deeper hole, 15 October). But there is no point in gaining power if you sell your soul to the devil. The BBC’s Blair & Brown: The New Labour Revolution, which he refers to, also attributes Labour’s success to vanquishing or at least suppressing the left of the party, thus bringing Labour into the electable mainstream.
This comfortable analysis forgets that no political party in this country has won an election in the past 30 years without the backing of News International. It is this and not the showmanship of Boris Johnson that explains why, despite all the U-turns and bungling of the Covid response, the Conservatives remain ahead in the polls.

Australian reportedly failed to commit himself in training

Ben Simmons has been suspended by the Philadelphia 76ers for one game due to conduct detrimental to the team. Simmons will miss the 76ers’ season opener on Wednesday night at New Orleans.
The guard was a holdout in training camp in the wake of his offseason trade demand. He reported last week and practiced Sunday and Monday with the Sixers. He was scheduled to practice and talk to the media on Tuesday but ESPN reported that Sixers coach Doc Rivers threw him out after he refused to participate in the final part of the session.

Anoosheh Ashoori, the British-Iranian dual national held in Evin prison in Tehran for more than four years, has had his request for conditional release and an appeal against his 10-year sentence thrown out.
Ashoori was informed by prison authorities that his last legal recourse within Iran was gone last Saturday, the same day that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told she had lost her appeal against a one-year further sentence for alleged propaganda activities against the regime. She has been held in Tehran since 2016, and is waiting to hear when and if she must return to Evin prison. She has already served a five-year sentence.

Samus Aran’s return after 20 years is welcome – but other games have taken up her mantle in the meantime
The recipe for a Metroid game is clear and concise: there’s a labyrinthine system of rooms and corridors, an oppressive science-fiction environment, an escalating series of power-ups. A good-feeling gun. A great-feeling jump. A limited map you unlock gradually and rewardingly. Metroid Dread is proficient at all of this: it feels good to play, for a while. But I found that it got tiresome. There is little to hold the player in the world beyond the feeling of a perfectly executed attack or dodge. In the 20 years since we last saw bounty hunter Samus Aran run around in one of these 2D space stations, there have been several indie games modelled on the Metroid format – such as Iconoclasts, and Hollow Knight – that offer far more atmosphere, depth and life than Dread’s slickly predictable tunnels.
Metroid Dread is a game about trying not to die alone in a cave system full of hostile fauna and predatory machines that are invested in hunting you down. This is pretty much all the storytelling you’re handed, outside of some panels of text and short and awkwardly placed cut-scenes at the start of the game that establish us in Samus Aran’s timeline. She will encounter old enemies, and some new ones; this planet has no allies for the player. She begins her quest all but totally disempowered, her suit deconstructed, and we lead her towards the surface, regaining her abilities along the way. This game does not offer much of a guiding hand, and the challenge is tough.
Metroid Dread is out now; £49.99

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Political self-interest is the prime minister’s guiding light. No amount of planetary jeopardy is going to change that
Boris Johnson’s recruitment to the global crusade against carbon emissions is, by his own admission, recent. On a visit to New York last month, the prime minister confessed to a back catalogue of newspaper columns that “weren’t entirely supportive of the current struggle”. He was making excuses for Anne-Marie Trevelyan, his trade secretary whose record of climate scepticism tilts into outright denial. (In 2012 she derided “global warming fanatics” for believing that the ice caps were melting.)
Around the same time, Johnson was querying the scientific consensus, dabbling in crackpot theories about sunspots and disparaging windfarms. In his defence, the prime minister has since declared that “the facts change and people change their minds”. At most, half of that statement is true. It was a fact that human activity was heating the planet when Johnson cavilled, and it is still a fact now.

A 96-year-old former secretary at a Nazi concentration camp has gone on trial in Germany for alleged complicity in the murder of more than 11,000 people imprisoned there, three weeks after she attempted to flee the proceedings.
Irmgard Furchner was pushed into the court in Itzehoe, northern Germany, strapped into a blue ambulance wheelchair and clutching a brown cloth bag. A silk patterned scarf, sunglasses and a medical mask covered her face.

‘I’ve been short of runs but my captaincy has been pretty good’

Eoin Morgan has backed himself to rediscover his form with the bat after a chastening time in the recently concluded Indian Premier League, and pledged to drop himself if he fails rather than hobble England’s chances of success at the Twenty20 World Cup.
Morgan’s form has been fragile for some time – he averages 14.5 in the 37 Twenty20 innings he has played over nearly a year since his last half‑century, covering the English summer, internationals last winter in South Africa and India and the IPL, both before and after its Covid-enforced mid-season interruption.

Amid the hundreds of pages of the UK government’s comprehensive net zero strategy, there is one glaring omission – Rishi Sunak.
The roadmap to end the nation’s contribution to the climate crisis by 2050 is comprehensive. But it is seriously underfunded and without Sunak’s backing, it could as easily become the route to climate hell as climate salvation.

• Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com
What’s the point of curly parsley? You never see anyone buying it, and recipes always specify flat-leaf. 
Colin, Stonehaven
“Curly parsley is not seen as glamorous, like Italian or French flat-leaf parsley, but as the garnish of the 1960s,” says Jane Scotter, who runs the revered biodynamic farm Fern Verrow in Herefordshire. “It’s just gone out of fashion, but it is by far the better tasting of the two.” And she’s in good company, with Fergus Henderson, chef and founder of St John in London, also firmly on #teamcurly. “It has substance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though the Welsh government’s drive to stop young people leaving is admirable, some of the main ‘push factors’ still apply
I grew up in Wales and consider myself Welsh, but I have lived in London – my birthplace – for 18 years, more than half my life. If you include periods spent living in France and Italy, my time living in Wales shrinks further still. Like many of my friends and classmates, I left when I was 18, and it would be a lie if I said that I wasn’t desperate to go. I wanted a “big life”, and felt that I needed to be in a big city to achieve that. Despite this, I still feel Welsh; identity can be a knotty thing. If you pressed me I suppose I would say that I’m “London Welsh”, part of the diaspora that has made the English capital our home.
I’ve been thinking about this as the Welsh government launches a drive to keep young Welsh people in their homeland. Thanks in part to a “brain drain” – always a slightly unpleasant term, I find, implying as it does that the people who choose to stay are lacking them – the proportion of working-age adults is dropping, which, coupled with an ageing population that tends to be poorer and sicklier than England’s, is causing alarm. It has effects on the language, too – the Welsh government hopes to have achieved a million Welsh speakers by 2050.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having changed their name to distance themselves from nationalistic fans, the indie rockers’ empathic, elemental new album shows they’re still wild at heart
With their propensity for foliage-covered stages and a large bear mascot that wanders through the audience at their gigs, Sea Power are used to people getting the wrong end of the stick. “The word ‘oddball’ has been put around, and that can put people off,” guitarist Martin Noble ruefully admits. But, 20 years on from their debut single, the band’s recent decision to change their name from British Sea Power marks a new beginning at a time of creative revival. The wacky bear is retiring and the band are fizzing with a new sense of purpose, fresh from finishing their new album Everything Was Forever, winning a Bafta for their soundtrack to the video game Disco Elysium, and performing their first gigs in two years. Noble has missed playing live so much that he compares going onstage to “coming up on an E”.
Their new name has been enthusiastically chanted by fans, and the sole complaint they’ve had came from “some fellas who had to make their own Sea Power T-shirts because we’d not brought merch out quick enough”, says Yan Scott Wilkinson, the band’s co-frontman, with brother Neil Wilkinson. In the end, the only truly negative reaction to dropping “British” came from social media and the rightwing press. The name British Sea Power “had become a monkey on our backs”, in the words of Noble, and the band had become uncomfortable that some people were wrongly interpreting it as nationalistic, even antagonistic – although to do that they would have had to ignore the band’s history of writing songs such as Waving Flags, a pro-immigration anthem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Randy Sue first saw a picture of Courtney on a friend’s wall, she jokingly called him her future husband. They finally met three years later, married and now live in Houston, Texas
Randy Sue was studying at college in Texas in the spring of 1966 when she went to visit a friend in Raymondville, near the Mexican border. “I spotted a picture of a handsome man on the wall and asked who it was. My friend told me it was her brother, Courtney, who was in Germany with the army,” she says. Randy Sue joked to her friend’s mother that she was going to be her daughter-in-law. “She hugged me and said she’d been praying for me,” she laughs.
But when Courtney received a letter from his sister telling him she had met “his future wife”, he was less than impressed. “I was 5,000 miles away and definitely didn’t want my sister telling me what to do,” he says. In 1968, he returned to Texas and found a job at a company that made office equipment. His sister continued her matchmaking attempts. “She kept telling each of us that the other one really wanted to meet up,” says Randy Sue. “But I’d just seen it as a joke.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a country of centralised power, he did all he could to make himself a man of Southend rather than simply Westminster
British politics rightly commemorates its own. David Amess, killed in his home constituency last week, was eulogised on Monday in the Commons and St Margaret’s church, Westminster, as what the prime minister called “one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics”. He was not a star of the parliamentary firmament, but rather that paragon: a “good constituency MP”. The solemn minute’s silence held in the House of Commons and the tributes to Amess from MPs testified to a profession under collective threat. It is one that lies at the heart of representational democracy: that of intermediary between the rulers and the ruled.
Amess’s death comes at what many see as a critical juncture in democracy’s theatre of public debate. MPs are exposed to criticism and attack as never before, thanks in large part to the glaringly inadequate regulation of social media. Male and female MPs, particularly female ones, are being subjected to appalling anonymous trolling. An Amnesty survey in the run-up to the 2017 general election found the MP Diane Abbott was in receipt of an average of 51 abusive tweets a day. Her colleague Jess Phillips has to keep in constant touch with the police. The atmosphere in which an MP must work is thus increasingly poisonous, with no effective action taken by either Facebook or Twitter.

Are morning people better than night owls? I was delighted to discover that they are not. The “morning morality effect” – the notion that our capacity to resist lying and cheating dwindles through the day – applies only to larks, research shows; nighthawks behave better in the evenings.
Morning people do, however, have a reputation for getting stuff done. Early rising is associated with energy, optimisation and efficiency; it is a foundational principle of all manner of self-help and self-actualisation programmes. “If you look at many of the most productive people in the world, they’ll have one thing in common: they were early risers,” says one wide-eyed zealot in the trailer for the motivational guru Hal Elrod’s film about his “miracle morning”, as Oprah Winfrey, Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Einstein flash past. Elrod’s Savers routine – silence, affirmations, visualisation, exercise, reading, scribing – is a classic of the genre, but he is only one of many urging us to seize the day super-early.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archaeological discoveries are shattering scholars’ long-held beliefs about how the earliest humans organised their societies – and hint at possibilities for our own
In some ways, accounts of “human origins” play a similar role for us today as myth did for ancient Greeks or Polynesians. This is not to cast aspersions on the scientific rigour or value of these accounts. It is simply to observe that the two fulfil somewhat similar functions. If we think on a scale of, say, the last 3m years, there actually was a time when someone, after all, did have to light a fire, cook a meal or perform a marriage ceremony for the first time. We know these things happened. Still, we really don’t know how. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to make up stories about what might have happened: stories which necessarily reflect our own fears, desires, obsessions and concerns. As a result, such distant times can become a vast canvas for the working out of our collective fantasies.
Let’s take just one example. Back in the 1980s, there was a great deal of buzz about a “mitochondrial Eve”, the putative common ancestor of our entire species. Granted, no one was claiming to have actually found the physical remains of such an ancestor, but DNA sequencing demonstrated that such an Eve must have existed, perhaps as recently as 120,000 years ago. And while no one imagined we’d ever find Eve herself, the discovery of a variety of other fossil skulls rescued from the Great Rift Valley in east Africa seemed to provide a suggestion as to what Eve might have looked like and where she might have lived. While scientists continued debating the ins and outs, popular magazines were soon carrying stories about a modern counterpart to the Garden of Eden, the original incubator of humanity, the savanna-womb that gave life to us all.

UK bond yields soar as markets brace for interest rate rise

Less than a month ago Andrew Bailey warned the “hard yards” were still to come. Britain’s economic recovery from Covid-19 was fading, inflationary pressures stalking the country would prove temporary and the Bank of England fiddling with interest rates would hardly produce more lorry drivers or make the wind blow for turbines.
Fast forward and the Bank’s governor appears to have changed his tune. Financial markets are betting that a rate increase is due within weeks after comments from Bailey over the weekend did little to dampen frenzied speculation.

Having left a council property that was in his name after his marriage broke down, Brathwaite was housed in temporary accommodation for two years. When the council reassessed his case it ruled he had made himself intentionally homeless, and as a result was not eligible for council housing.
